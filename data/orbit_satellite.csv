0,US-7578482-B2,20090825,US,35908759,Catalyzed decomposing structural payload foam,"A high energy, e.g., ultraviolet (UV), catalyzed decomposing foam encapsulating a payload to be boosted in space provides an ultra-light weight, adaptable means to facilitate survival of much lighter, smaller satellites and space hardware under boost environment. The decomposable foam is to contain multiple satellites within a booster payload in lieu of the traditionally heavy and complex structural framework. The catalyzed decomposing foam significantly lowers the weight and structure of all space hardware. This packaging system is especially beneficial where several or even hundreds of satellites are required for a constellation system, thereby significantly benefiting all technologies applied in space, ranging from the telecommunication industry to DOD applications. In addition to weight and cost savings, advantages of this foam are many in that it is adaptable to any payload shape as it may be injected, sprayed, formed, molded, easily cut or manufactured to support any geometry required.","['244/173.1', '244/171.7', '244/173.3', '401/96.', '252/363.5', '428/305.5']","['B64G2001/643', 'C08K5/14', 'B64G1/002', 'F42B15/08', 'B64G1/641', 'Y10T428/249954']",['B64G1/36'],"['GB-1430085-A', 'US-2002109047-A1', 'US-4076655-A', 'US-3863254-A']","[-0.08547254, -0.18341614, 0.04973566, 0.06705351, 0.17320733, 0.11979089, -0.027364854, -0.10284667, 0.12677665, -0.122667365, -0.0047319415, 0.007008724, 0.18214233, -0.032561637, -0.037175473, 0.18305294, 0.13745236, 0.16399151, -0.18789695, 0.17886731, -0.22232488, 0.0641827, -0.14263234, -0.13605487, 0.16124904, -0.09784907, -0.010065114, 0.07405642, 0.093944624, 0.055457316, 0.12852444, 0.0047394577, -0.0353257, 0.011554807, -0.04409231, 0.1487114, -0.008234836, -0.084054604, 0.074974746, 0.20999108, 0.07539608, -0.16494225, 0.171342, -0.25963342, -0.15653889, 0.15891258, 0.021392563, 0.024519568, -0.04716427, 0.13149492, -0.12829621, 0.047872685, -0.014810148, -0.14567035, 0.116262875, -0.18178925, -0.023448981, -0.14085048, 0.073128745, 0.19173482, 0.006849333, 0.21657455, -0.021049056, 0.20510426]",True

A configuration management mechanism provides a selection of acceleration configuration for particular addresses of devices that may communicate through the communications channels. Acceleration may be bypassed for particular addresses or classes of devices within the network and priorities may be assigned, permitting a cut-off of acceleration when a threshold number of sessions is reached. The method and system may also allow a higher priority class of session to preempt lower priority session by removing resources from the lower priority session and assigning them to the higher priority session. The data rate of the lower priority session is then lowered (due to the absence of acceleration or reduced buffer size) to reduce traffic flow.","['370/229.', '370/395.42']","['H04L69/163', 'H04L69/161', 'H04L29/06', 'H04L69/329', 'H04L67/322', 'H04L69/16']","['H04L29/06', 'H04L29/08']",['US-6327364-B1'],",",True

     A member station may gain access by transmitting during its allocated time slot. A time frame is defined as having a time duration equal to at least the time for the burst intervals of all the member stations preferably with at least a small guard time between bursts. A super-frame is defined as containing a plurality of frames which are sufficient in number to provide for a measurement period, a correction period and advance notice period and a propagation period. 
     Synchronization at a station is attained by receiving a reference signal transmitted by one member station and returned from the repeater to all stations; measuring the magnitude and polarity of the difference of the super frame timing reference relative to that of the station; transmitting said difference in advance of correction and then correcting said station timing relative to the reference during a correction phase. 
     Other member stations receive the different information only during the advance notice phase and correct only during the correction phase of a super frame, even in the absence of receiving a timing pulse for providing synchronization. 
     Means are provided for facilitating synchronization between receiving and transmitting facilities at each station over a reduced time period.","['375/211.', '370/324.', '375/362.']",['H04B7/2126'],"['H04B7/15', 'H04B7/212', 'H04J3/06', 'H04J3/00']","['US-3982075-A', 'US-3789142-A', 'US-3772475-A', 'US-3778715-A', 'US-3730998-A', 'US-4028497-A', 'US-3922496-A', 'US-3562432-A', 'US-3813496-A']","[-0.14231735, 0.13059393, -0.1729439, -0.11250548, -0.037814748, 0.029066466, 0.097868964, -0.12827276, 0.040292323, -0.031908587, 0.0077384976, 0.08100185, 0.025119267, -0.04683055, 0.0795198, -0.048743665, 0.2497359, 0.10820769, -0.17636184, 0.13382676, 0.007004759, -0.0016320305, -0.07861617, 0.14100231, 0.0678494, 0.08373102, 0.111449905, 0.1363237, 0.21619086, -0.11311295, -0.21541448, -0.2702034, -0.10445494, -0.018502096, -0.020171931, 0.08427238, -0.039728075, -0.15912539, -0.10820266, 0.1737209, -0.1302912, 0.06182688, -0.039781243, -0.11065212, 0.042221263, 0.008910675, 0.0044552237, 0.20252596, -0.020176595, 0.12567033, -0.17127082, 0.07322331, 0.13451275, -0.014692822, 0.0957911, -0.020104555, -0.06013579, -0.032897208, -0.16954361, 0.17390396, -0.006681241, 0.19928476, -0.29377896, 0.2581722]",True

The C-band feed is located in front of and to the side of the subreflector for transmission of radiation along a straight path through the FSS to the main reflector. The locating of the two feeds to the side of the subreflector permits the subreflector to be stowed by folding down upon the C-band feed, and the main reflector to be stowed by folding down upon both the S-band feed and the stowed subreflector.","['343/781.P', '343/DIG.002', '343/909.', '343/753.']","['H01Q25/007', 'H01Q1/288', 'Y10S343/02', 'H01Q13/0275']","['H01Q13/02', 'H01Q25/00', 'H01Q21/30', 'H01Q15/20', 'H01Q1/28', 'H01Q19/17', 'H01Q19/19', 'H01Q21/06']","['US-4387377-A', 'US-3395059-A', 'US-5086304-A', 'US-5373302-A', 'US-5258771-A', 'US-4562441-A']",",",False

59,US-7359312-B2,20080415,US,23575629,Method and apparatus for identifying an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) terrestrial repeater using inactive sub-carriers,"A terrestrial repeater is disclosed for use in a satellite transmission system that may also include a plurality of satellites. The terrestrial repeaters are implemented as OFDM transmitters to minimize the channel impairments caused by multi-path propagation. The OFDM terrestrial repeaters differentially encode the transmitted signal over frequency, as opposed to time, in order to avoid channel phase distortion. The OFDM receiver allocates two unmodulated sub-carriers as pilot bins and thereby provides two sub-carriers as a reference within each OFDM symbol. At the OFDM receiver, the two unmodulated pilot bins contain no phase information and provide a reference for the differential demodulation performed by the OFDM receiver. The OFDM transmitter operates in two modes, namely, a normal mode and a transmitter identifier information (TII) mode. The TII mode contains all of the functions of the normal mode, and also transmits a repeater identification signal with the customer data, using the inactive OFDM sub-carriers (bins). In a normal mode, the OFDM transmitter optionally fills unused (inactive) sub-carriers with zeroes and in a TII mode, the OFDM transmitter uses at least some of the unused (inactive) sub-carriers to transmit the transmitter identifier information (TII). The predefined TII value is mapped onto a set of complex symbols. The TII signal facilitates the receiver test equipment in associating the received signal with the terrestrial repeater(s) that generate the TII signal.",['370/208.'],"['H04H60/54', 'H04L27/2601']","['H04L27/26', 'H04B7/216', 'H04J11/00']","['US-5946293-A', 'EP-0902563-A1', 'US-6134267-A', 'US-5726978-A', 'GB-2261142-A', 'US-5487069-A', 'US-5796785-A', 'US-6072769-A', 'JP-H11215095-A', 'JP-H10200458-A', 'US-5544198-A', 'US-6175550-B1', 'US-6456653-B1']","[0.03571752, 0.091644056, 0.06589808, -0.101305425, 0.051883467, -0.090988174, -0.06759488, -0.18526992, 0.0811764, -0.111945294, -0.061019037, -0.05330453, -0.10217129, 0.003958948, 0.08247706, 0.07398436, 0.21104816, 0.16821894, -0.21096034, 0.064935096, 0.040029466, 0.06799841, 0.0023709263, 0.06693969, 0.034656882, -0.042554207, 0.17623453, 0.067540415, 0.013135264, -0.13544464, -0.29413417, -0.16663294, -0.25006407, -0.12452465, 0.010749454, -0.03228205, -0.04178411, -0.21434976, -0.1137542, 0.2241357, -0.17060044, 0.10892336, 0.044763517, 0.07348776, 0.06338091, -0.030901559, 0.0044647404, 0.04360068, -0.01598231, 0.15152736, -0.22908573, 0.14264426, -0.07726309, 0.09814678, -0.06331554, -0.016039897, -0.099500716, 0.038291883, -0.2143896, 0.021106513, 0.100003384, 0.27356106, -0.20251489, 0.16990662]",True

The high accuracy vehicle navigation system is highly demanded for advanced AGVs. Although high positioning accuracy is achievable by a high performance RTK-GPS receiver, the performance should be considerably degraded in a high-blockage environment due to tall buildings and other obstacles. The present navigation system is to provide decimetre-level positioning accuracy in such a severe environment for precise GPS positioning. The horizontal navigation system is composed of a low cost Fiber Optic Gyro (FOG) and a precise odometer. The navigation errors are estimated using a tightly coupled Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The measurements of the EKF are double differenced code and carrier phase from a dual frequency GPS receiver and relative positions derived from laser scanner measurements.","['701/472.', '701/480.', '342/357.31', '701/477.', '342/358.']","['G05D1/024', 'G01S19/44', 'G05D1/0272', 'G05D1/027', 'G01C21/165', 'G05D1/0278']","['G01S19/29', 'G01S19/46', 'G01S19/21', 'G01C21/00', 'G01S19/11', 'G01S19/05', 'G01S19/48']","['US-6694260-B1', 'US-6269306-B1', 'US-7110880-B2', 'US-6282496-B1', 'US-6520448-B1', 'US-2005137799-A1', 'US-2003135327-A1']",",",True

The computer algorithm updates the characteristics of the model relating to the aging and temperature of the oscillator, using for example, a Kalman filter as an adaptive filter, in accordance with a cumulative phase error in the PLL calculated during a given time interval. By the algorithm, the subsequent model predicts the future frequency state of the oscillator on which it was trained. The predicted frequency of the model functions as a reference to correct the frequency of the oscillator in the event that no input reference timing signal is available. Also, the calculated phase error is stored and is used while no input reference timing signal or accurate predicted frequency value is available.

The system associates a color with each land class and colors the image pixel corresponding to each area of the land with the color associated with its class. The system allows an operator to supply input calibration data controlling the color associated with each class. Through an iterative process of adjusting the calibration data so as to make colors in the land image produced by the system conform to known colors of representative areas of that land, the operator can make the system produce an accurately colored image of the entire land.

The receiver includes a conventional receiver channel ( 36 ), having a bandpass filter ( 40 ) for establishing the sampling bandwidth prior to digitizing a plurality of received satellite signals, each having a different frequency. The receiver also includes a calibration channel ( 50 ) in which multiple satellite signals are bandbass filtered (in filter  58 ) at a single intermediate frequency, to avoid errors resulting from group delay variation introduced by passing multiple satellite signals through a common bandpass filter. The calibration channel ( 50 ) downconverts ( 56 ) to the intermediate frequency, bandpass filters ( 58 ), and then upconverts ( 60 ) again. Each satellite signal in turn is processed in this manner by selecting appropriate difference frequencies for downconversion and upconversion. The calibration channel ( 50 ) produces a set of reference carrier phase measurements that can be applied to correct errors in carrier phase measurements generated by the conventional receiver channels ( 36 ).","['375/316.', '342/357.62', '701/479.', '455/12.1']","['G01S19/43', 'G01S19/36', 'G01S19/235']","['G01S19/23', 'G01S1/00', 'G01S5/14', 'G01S19/43']","['US-5663734-A', 'US-5884214-A', 'US-5526291-A', 'US-5311194-A', 'US-5847678-A', 'US-5914685-A', 'US-5630208-A', 'US-6091785-A', 'US-6104340-A', 'US-6133871-A', 'US-5831574-A']",",",True

Customers preselect from a list of available music in advance using an interactive screen selector, and pay only for music that they choose to playback for their enjoyment. An antipiracy “ID tag” is woven into the recorded music so that any illegal copies therefrom may be traced to the purchase transaction. Music is transmitted on a fixed schedule or through an active scheduling process that monitors music requests from all or a subset of satellite receivers and adjust scheduling according to demand for various CD&#39;s. Receivers store selections that are likely to be preferred by a specific customer. In those instances where weather conditions, motion of atmospheric layers or dish obstructions result in data loss, the system downloads the next transmission of the requested CD and uses both transmissions to produce a “good copy”. In conjunction with the blanket  20  transmission of more popular music, an automated CD manufacturing facility may be provided to manufacture CD&#39;s that are not frequently requested and distribute them by ground transportation.","['705/52.', '705/59.', '705/26.1', '705/51.', '705/26.61', '705/26.8', '705/27.1']","['H04H60/06', 'H04N21/8106', 'H04N21/262', 'H04H60/17', 'H04H60/27',

A transmitter emits a time-synchronized signal directed to a target. The transmitter radiates L-band RF signals. The transmitter can be positioned on an airborne or ground platform. A constellation of communication satellites receives and time stamps the time-synchronized signal reflected from the target to form an active image of the target. The constellation of communication satellites have multiple roles other than active imaging, such as providing voice and data communications. The time-synchronized signal reflected from the target can be received by multiple satellites within the constellation of communication satellites or by multiple antenna disposed on one satellite within the constellation of communication satellites.","['342/191.', '342/57.', '342/60.', '342/25.A', '342/25.R']","['G01S13/003', 'G01S13/0209', 'G01S13/87', 'G01S13/86', 'G01S7/003', 'G01S13/89']",['G01S13/00'],"['US-6400306-B1', 'US-2003222820-A1', 'US-2003122705-A1', 'US-5563606-A', 'US-7298866-B2', 'US-2005104763-A1', 'US-2002009059-A1', 'US-2002041328-A1', 'US-2006164288-A1']","[-0.0036752606, -0.06554164, -0.06575242, -0.0257921, 0.041312717, 0.055699676, -0.08160955, -0.12124206, 0.096951135, -0.1856024, -0.12476272, 0.08740623, 0.0015111725, -0.09365614, 0.023591315, 0.075539924, 0.18822604, 0.10035186, -0.29052755, 0.2759612, 0.17007214, 0.03184339, 0.015064024, 0.12880616, 0.020309703, -0.14701933, 0.0661425, 0.25352368, 0.21979785, -0.13067181, -0.0151906535, -0.17555661, -0.22850014, -0.07104796, -0.07479269, 0.032160226, -0.063149676, -0.22876376, -0.071771525, 0.15042375, -0.1196403, 0.090055116, -0.076028146, -0.01672381, -0.014864319, -0.12094602, 0.0459799, 0.2067692, -0.09375174, 0.040451955, -0.13456212, 0.06156134, -0.16437283, 0.041552234, 0.12614392, -0.039381567, 0.17683339, 0.035580426, -0.047035635, 0.024183283, 0.0598905, 0.22662364, -0.18635337, 0.052807216]",True

130,US-5809063-A,19980915,US,24966967,Coherent detection architecture for remote calibration of coherent systems using direct sequence spread spectrum transmission of reference and calibration signals,"An architecture that provides for coherent detection of the relative amplitude and phase of a calibration signal used in the remote calibration of an active transmitting or receiving phased array system employs two coherent signals, one being a reference signal and the other being the calibration signal that contains the relative amplitude and phase information desired in the calibration process. Direct sequence spread spectrum techniques are used to transmit the two coherent signals. Continuous time binary antipodal waveform signals are generated and used to transmit the reference and calibration signals. Relevant amplitude and phase information needed for the calibration can be extracted while compensating for non-synchronized oscillators and the effects of Doppler shifts due to relative motion of the transmitting and receiving platforms. The detection architecture is effective for satellite-based phased array systems, including geostationary, medium and low earth orbit communication satellites, and space-based synthetic aperture radar reconnaissance satellites.","['342/360.', '375/228.', '342/174.', '375/141.']","['H04B7/216', 'G01S19/235', 'H01Q3/267', 'H04B17/20', 'H04B17/14', 'G01S7/288', 'G01S13/90', 'G01S7/4004']","['H04B7/216', 'G01S7/40', 'H01Q3/26', 'H04B17/00', 'G01S7/288', 'G01S1/00', 'G01S13/90']","['US-5559519-A', 'US-4675880-A', 'US-5677696-A', 'US-5530449-A', 'US-4621365-A']","[-0.04197311, 0.044870965, -0.079465546, -0.03527278, 0.048536267, 0.00071797083, 0.0816234, -0.22617498, 0.05036972, -0.13860755, -0.008669797, -0.03752147, 0.03985027, -0.24460499, 0.0344551, -0.006423025, 0.016010813, 0.07629861, -0.14364716, 0.1556188, 0.10701063, -0.0520787, -0.066001326, 0.17410079, -0.0036781973, 0.035200387, 0.11610345, 0.18985943, 0.24609686, -0.20957862, -0.05057969, -0.2724654, -0.14650525, -0.07647397, -0.12006967, -0.010527868, 0.07257783, -0.12061745, -0.14360115, 0.32686213, -0.14704415, 0.025286159, -0.013293293, 0.013921027, 0.012249295, 0.07971105, 0.05551276, 0.09895033, -0.002804574, 0.09715748, -0.087896675, 0.029953096, -0.08833228, -0.012898774, -0.017236723, 0.14688437, 0.10497606, 0.039712038, -0.153089, 0.050910134, 0.17822418, 0.20927696, -0.28172246, 0.19544943]",True

Next, the difference between the position data from satellites and the position data based on the running histories at each moment when the position data is received from satellites is calculated and those differences are averaged to obtain a correction value. Finally the current position of the vehicle is calculated by correcting the position data based on the running histories by the newest correction value. Consequently, in the autonomous running control system an accurate position of the vehicle can be found without stopping the vehicle, even when the position data from satellites does not have a sufficient accuracy.

The hybrid gateway intercepts requests made by the requesting terminals and, if necessary, reduces the advertized window size of requests made by the requesting terminal, thereby reducing the transmission speed of the link and therefore the bandwidth of the link.","['709/223.', '709/225.', '709/250.']","['H04L2212/00', 'H04L12/5692', 'H04L69/168', 'H04B7/18584', 'H04L43/00', 'H04L69/16', 'H04L69/163', 'H04L47/70', 'H04L12/2856', 'H04L47/762', 'H04L47/30', 'H04L47/15', 'H04L47/14', 'H04L47/10', 'H04L47/20', 'H04L47/824', 'H04L47/803', 'H04L47/805', 'H04L47/825', 'H04L69/169', 'H04L47/27', 'H04L69/161', 'H04L61/10', 'H04L47/748', 'H04L29/06', 'H04L47/2425', 'H04L43/0888', 'H04L29/12009', 'H04L43/16', 'H04L29/12018']","['H04B7/185', 'H04L29/06', 'G06F15/173', 'H04L12/28', 'H04L12/26', 'H04L12/56', 'H04L29/12']","['US-6222856-B1', 'US-4959872-A', 'US-5157662-A', 'US-4847892-A', 'US-6519636-B2', 'US-5038265-A', 'US-6249530-B1', 'US-4636879-A', 'US-5504814-A', 'US-6292465-B1', 'US-5465213-C1', 'US-5699369-A', 'US-6016388-A', 'US-6038216-A', 'US-5534913-A', 'US-5799002-A', 'US-6076113-A', 'US-4802215-A', 'US-5257369-A', 'US-5594776-A', 'US-5101267-A', 'US-4358672-A', 'US-5394469-A', 'US-6185619-B1', 'US-5592173-A', 'US-5303042-A', 'US-2001043609-A1', 'US-5111504-A', 'US-5548753-A', 'US-5491800-A', 'US-5481609-A', 'US-5404505-A', 'US-5590200-A', 'US-5029207-A', 'US-5237610-A', 'US-5764641-A', 'US-5465213-A', 'US-4135156-A', 'US-5564076-A', 'US-4680688-A', 'US-4724520-A', 'US-5359367-A', 'US-5953506-A', 'US-6078953-A', 'US-5426635-A', 'US-5483466-A', 'US-6125177-A', 'US-5249164-A', 'US-4775974-A', 'US-5483595-A', 'US-6415329-B1', 'US-5245429-A', 'US-5452357-A', 'US-5659350-A', 'US-4720873-A', 'US-5634190-A', 'US-5341425-A', 'US-5404583-A', 'US-5420866-A', 'US-5506904-A', 'US-5526404-A', 'US-6219713-B1', 'US-5367571-A', 'US-5163046-A', 'US-5223923-A', 'US-5131010-A', 'US-7028088-B1', 'US-5319712-A', 'US-6154776-A', 'US-5594782-A', 'US-5101478-A', 'US-4829569-A', 'US-5293250-A', 'US-4663743-A', 'US-5568554-A', 'US-5675742-A', 'US-6105064-A', 'US-5347304-A', 'US-6285658-B1', 'US-5319705-A', 'US-5019910-A', 'US-4793813-A', 'US-5301358-A', 'US-4538073-A', 'US-6160797-A', 'US-5337044-A', 'US-4940963-A', 'US-5532914-A', 'US-6438101-B1', 'US-6502131-B1', 'US-4768228-A', 'US-5058138-A', 'US-5412660-A', 'US-5652795-A', 'US-5387994-A', 'US-5309351-A', 'US-4777657-A', 'US-6411616-B1', 'US-4018993-A', 'US-4736422-A', 'US-5400401-A', 'US-5319707-A', 'US-4933936-A', 'US-6078564-A', 'US-4599647-A', 'US-4918653-A', 'US-5627528-A', 'US-6473793-B1', 'US-4686698-A', 'US-6330226-B1', 'US-6046980-A', 'US-5335276-A', 'US-6137777-A', 'US-5394561-A', 'US-6987741-B2', 'US-6085241-A', 'US-5359593-A', 'US-5193151-A', 'US-4009346-A']",",",True

The method contemplates that selective availability (S/A) is either disabled or satellites with S/A active can be identified and not used. In one method, a GPS receiver is positioned at a reference location with a known position. The apparent position determined by the GPS receiver is then compared to the known position to determine an error correction. Preferably, the error correction is made to each satellite&#39;s pseudorange as a timing or range correction. When the GPS receiver moves, the error correction is applied to each satellite&#39;s pseudorange. The satellites used for position determination are chosen based on the &#34;quality&#34; of the satellite. Here, &#34;quality&#34; can mean the geometry of the satellite relative to the earth and the absence of SIA. With the combination of GPS and Glonass satellites to choose from, the four or five highest quality satellites are used for the position calculation. The method contemplates the addition of a new satellite to the current &#34;quality&#34; set of satellites being used for position determination. Range from the new satellite is compared to the range of the GPS receiver using the position based on the current &#34;quality&#34; set of satellites. Thus, a range correction for the new satellite is continuously computed. Once the new satellite is added to the &#34;quality&#34; set of satellites being used for position determination, the range correction is continuously applied to the new satellite to enhance accuracy.","['342/458.', '342/358.', '342/357.24']","['G01S19/41', 'A63B2069/3605']","['G01S19/09', 'A63B69/36', 'G01S5/14', 'G01S19/11', 'G01S1/00']","['US-5270936-A', 'US-5364093-A', 'US-5056106-A']","[-0.07601035, 0.043546576, -0.0639369, 0.031037666, 0.07229939, -0.016759254, 0.072300635, -0.017890504, 0.09773773, -0.0062963427, -0.16060768, 0.18579254, 0.17102791, -0.05967259, -0.04937293, 0.067398146, 0.12878887, -0.08416299, -0.2638504, 0.10594152, 0.25747687, -0.10529214, 0.0021339932, 0.1462726, -0.09735461, 0.03746713, 0.044208694, 0.22053938, 0.15364094, -0.017296318, 0.18961754, -0.21540682, -0.044175718, -0.046875957, 0.003705181, 0.1221326, -0.02974323, -0.26929733, -0.07591889, 0.1285426, -0.31384072, -0.18811387, 0.023922041, 0.13293242, -0.08048005, 0.043397047, -0.012166149, 0.15035245, 0.033240035, 0.0068040835, 0.06297903, -0.011498616, -0.050747912, 0.025491612, -0.021873284, -0.13381933, 0.14651541, 0.1933733, -0.09940846, 0.122443624, -0.0015929996, 0.14865892, -0.23810129, 0.089973286]",True

The set of parameters needed for the integration is small compared to current methods which require transmission of a complete set of ephemeris and other parameters for each satellite. Since the set of parameters is relatively small, it requires less communication resources to transmit compared to current methods.

From the PRN reference code sequences produced in the receiver, a PRN code calibration signal is produced, which is up-converted to the carrier frequency and then coupled into the HF front-end as a pseudo satellite navigation signal by means of a directional coupler ( 20 ) directly after the antenna, which pseudo satellite navigation signal is also tracked in the digital signal processor as an addition signal, which makes it possible to calibrate the HF front-end for the two partial bands during the normal satellite navigation signal reception.

Exchange of ballast water in the open ocean has been determined to be the best available means to reduce such introduction. The present invention utilizes the automatic detection of a change in parameters such as pump activity and ballast water chemistry as indicators of when and where ballast water exchange has been completed, indicating compliance with governmental guidelines or regulations. A pump activation sensor, flow meter or volume indicator determines when ballast water movement into and out of a ballast tank occurs. A chemical composition probe automatically determines the chemical composition of the ballast water. During the ballast water exchange procedure, an onboard indicator alerts when the chemical composition is equal to that of the open ocean. Geographic location of the ship is automatically determined using a self-contained GPS system. A set of data of the chemical composition and location and other relevant data is collected and stored for later transmission to a centralized Internet server. Upon entering a US port (or any appropriate time using a satellite data connection, the stored data is automatically transmitted and uploaded to the server using existing communication infrastructure. The appropriate governmental body, i.e. the USCG, can easily and securely access a record of this ballast water exchange.",['702/2.'],"['B63J99/00', 'B63J4/002', 'C02F2209/008', 'H04Q9/02', 'C02F2103/008', 'C02F2209/05', 'B63J2099/006', 'B63B2203/00']",['G06F19/00'],"['US-5983822-A', 'US-5753108-A', 'US-6456197-B1', 'US-4830757-A', 'US-6230645-B1', 'US-5532679-A', 'US-6444119-B1', 'US-RE31023-E', 'US-6269763-B1', 'US-5006260-A', 'US-5075014-A']","[-0.046987362, -0.034708228, -0.08180572, -0.011160269, 0.06685679, -0.050780497, 0.015943166, -0.072682776, -0.034019057, 0.053225003, -0.08937999, 0.08024158, 0.04973701, 0.17100823, -0.033571307, 0.17658451, 0.15347295, -0.05767108, -0.15381694, 0.2912589, 0.059153855, -0.0649367, -0.12240173, -0.12300534, -0.01744162, -0.049156625, 0.11597372, 0.08857166, 0.20631796, -0.057094507, 0.23566955, -0.0316448, 0.073517635, -0.15009946, -0.08698415, -0.028689442, -0.010224259, -0.24771091, -0.037196346, 0.0421503, -0.18937978, -0.0101575665, -0.19706284, 0.022864953, -0.05078166, -0.02867177, 0.0015169736, -0.009819799, -0.020872127, 0.03501336, 0.10391482, 0.027945213, -0.018524986, 0.047639072, 0.354478, 0.14254412, 0.10801308, 0.05955318, 0.020048978, 0.16144763, -0.037395064, 0.3658939, -0.067381255, 0.26843846]",True

At the moon, the satellite is in the so-called fuzzy boundary or weak stability age boundary. A negligibly small maneuver can then bring it back to the Earth on a reverse BCT to the desired Earth inclination. Another maneuver puts it into the new ellipse at the earth. In the case of satellites launched from Vandenberg AFB into LEO in a circular orbit of an altitude of 700 km with an inclination of 34°, approximately 6 km/s is required to change the inclination to 90°. The previous flight time associated with this method was approximately 170 days. A modification of this method also achieves a significant savings and unexpected benefits in energy as measured by Delta-V, where the flight time is also substantially reduced to 88 or even 6 days.","['244/158.5', '701/531.', '701/13.']","['B64G1/007', 'B64G1/242', 'B64G2001/247']","['B64G1/24', 'B64G1/00', 'B64G1/10', 'G05D1/10']","['US-5158249-A', 'US-5199672-A', 'US-3676581-A', 'US-3532298-A', 'US-5506780-A', 'US-5507454-A', 'US-5120008-A', 'US-5421540-A', 'US-6059233-A', 'US-5067672-A', 'US-4288051-A', 'US-T100604-I4', 'US-5433726-A', 'US-5163640-A', 'US-4618112-A', 'US-5568904-A', 'US-5681011-A', 'US-4599697-A', 'US-5595360-A', 'US-5452869-A', 'US-5064152-A']","[0.097417444, -0.20802024, 0.014610907, 0.038780414, 0.03994761, -0.06900901, 0.0981705, -0.051696412, 0.11223112, -0.085011296, -0.17823984, 0.24083939, 0.2419572, -0.19401333, 0.03847486, 0.08710083, 0.044166286, 0.028486004, -0.15465142, 0.2105532, 0.103479005, 0.15466608, -0.22797953, 0.08444234, -0.019934854, -0.11937013, 0.07226561, 0.07716496, 0.2602779, -0.13365747, 0.024732495, -0.1408803, -0.09694457, 0.1288315, -0.16960356, 0.08118585, 0.03313626, -0.25308022, 0.08418239, 0.1365036, -0.11303843, -0.16490187, 0.14867516, -0.13177244, -0.12720272, 0.062020183, -0.034375954, 0.2757404, 0.0647742, -0.054035272, -0.14939316, -0.08511065, 0.07924664, 0.00203102, 0.015204527, -0.018076623, 0.14978696, 0.042395897, 0.038982257, 0.018720645, 0.08727476, -0.024663828, -0.09071321, 0.019744486]",True

Each reference station n(n=1, 2, . . . , N) receives GPS signals from at least four common-view GPS satellites, numbered m=1, 2, . . . , M (M≧4), computes its own GPS-determined location coordinates, compares these coordinates with its known location coordinates, determines the pseudorange corrections PRC(t;t0;m;n) for its GPS-determined location, and transmits these correction signals to a central station located within or adjacent to the region S. The central station retransmits the pseudorange correction signals throughout the region S. A mobile GPS station within or adjacent to the region S has stored within it the coordinates (u&#39;,v&#39;,w&#39;) of the GPS-determined last location of that mobile station and the spatial coordinates (u n (k),v n (k),w n (k)) (k=1, 2 , . . . , K; K&gt;3) of K GPS reference stations within S that are closest to the last-determined location of that mobile station. The mobile station then computes the differential GPS corrections for the GPS-determined present location of that mobile station. Alternatively, the reference stations can transmit to the central station unprocessed GPS signals for determination of the pseudorange correction signals at the central station. This approach can be modified if the region R is two-dimensional, where only two coordinates u and v are needed, or if the region R is one-dimensional, where only one coordinate u is needed.

The system incorporates the use of differential GPS to provide increased accuracy and robustness for aircraft and vehicles using GPS as the primary terminal area navigation system. An antenna is precisely located and identified with GPS compatible coordinate references. GPS signals are received with the antenna and supplied to a differential GPS base station. The base station calculates psuedorange and delta range corrections for each tracked satellite. Calculated differential corrections are then broadcast to vehicles in the local area using a radio transmitter. Vehicles receive the broadcast differential corrections and calculate differentially corrected position, velocity and time (PVT) information. This information is used on aboard the vehicle for navigational or automatic dependent surveillance purposes.

Once a servicing need is identified, a destination orbit is identified for the space vehicle and a minimum energy path is identified. If the time to the next launch window between the docking orbit and the destination orbit happens to be near enough to allow for a timely rendezvous, the space vehicle is moved directly to the destination orbit. The space vehicle can be a vehicle designed to be piloted by humans or telerobotically. In one implementation, the inactive space vehicle is docked in an Intermediate LEO orbit (altitudes of approximately 250 km to approximately 500 km) and is used to rendezvous with objects in High LEO orbits (altitudes of approximately 500 km to approximately 1500 km) or objects in Low LEO orbits (altitudes of approximately 250 km or less).

In addition, several of these techniques allow geo-location to be performed on optical and infra-red radiation sources, which can enable tracking of any emitter by existing or newly designed surveillance satellites, including commercial and military aircraft, and hostile missiles or other optically active targets. Intermittent single burst coded signals radiated by the emitting source, which for personal security applications can be extremely small and easily carried in a concealed fashion, can be detected at one or more satellites or receive nodes and relayed to a central monitoring station, or operations center, where signals are processed and the location of the source is determined.

The usual way to change the inclination is perform a maneuver by firing the rocket engines at the periapsis of the ellipse. This then forces the satellite into the desired inclination. There is a substantially more fuel efficient way to change the inclination. This is done by an indirect route by first doing a maneuver to bring the satellite to the moon on a BCT (Ballistic Capture Transfer). At the moon, the satellite is in the so called fuzzy boundary or weak stability boundary. A negligibly small maneuver can then bring it back to the earth on a reverse BCT to the desired earth inclination. Another maneuver puts it into the new ellipse at the earth. In the case of satellites launched from Vandenberg AFB into LEO in a circular orbit of an altitude of 700 km with an inclination of 34°, approximately 6 km/s is required to change the inclination to 90°. The previous flight time associated with this method was approximately 170 days. A modification of this method also achieves a significant savings and unexpected benefits in energy as measured by Delta-V, where the flight time is also substantially reduced to 88 or even 6 days.","['244/158.5', '701/531.', '701/13.']","['B64G1/007', 'B64G1/242', 'B64G2001/247']","['B64G1/10', 'B64G1/24', 'B64G1/00', 'G05D1/10']","['US-5158249-A', 'US-5199672-A', 'US-3676581-A', 'US-3532298-A', 'US-5506780-A', 'US-5507454-A', 'US-5120008-A', 'US-5421540-A', 'US-6059233-A', 'US-5067672-A', 'US-4288051-A', 'US-T100604-I4', 'US-5433726-A', 'US-5163640-A', 'US-4618112-A', 'US-5568904-A', 'US-5681011-A', 'US-4599697-A', 'US-5595360-A', 'US-5452869-A', 'US-5064152-A']",",",True

A roaming mobile station communicates with a visited network and has a data connection to a home network. The mobile station sends a request for positioning assistance to a home position determining entity (H-PDE) in the home network. The H-PDE determines that base station almanac (BSA) data applicable for the mobile station is not locally available and sends a request for location information for the mobile station to a designated network entity. This entity may be a BSA server storing BSA data for different networks or a visited PDE (V-PDE) in the visited network. The H-PDE receives location information (e.g., BSA data, assistance data, and/or a position estimate for the mobile station) from the designated network entity and provides positioning assistance to the mobile station based on the received location information.","['455/411.', '455/433.', '342/357.42']","['H04W88/08', 'G01S5/0236', 'H04W64/00', 'G01S19/05']","['H04W88/08', 'H04W64/00', 'G01S5/02', 'H04M1/66']","['US-7123928-B2', 'US-2005227689-A1', 'US-2005020309-A1', 'US-7383049-B2', 'US-2005255857-A1', 'US-2005125493-A1', 'US-2006036365-A1']",",",False

Attached directly to this line is a strong back assembly having a fixed lateral width with ends thereon. Attached to the ends of the strong back assembly are thin, high strength straps which are connected to a pair of tensile universal joints which are further connected to, by way of this high strength straps, to a pair of trunnions. The trunnions are connected to the payload support frame which may have a satellite payload therein. The three orthogonal axes of the test device allow rotation to ±45 degrees, ±60 degrees and &gt;360 degrees, simultaneously in roll, yaw, and pitch respectively. The thin fabric strap allows movement with virtually no friction or suspension resistance. The strap&#39;s elastic restoring torque being very small is overcome transparently by adjusting the overturning moments in initial balancing. Because straps such as the above can only sustain tensile loads, multiple straps are used in combination angles to sustain the shear load as a result of roll rotation. The yaw axis joint may have instead a thin homogeneous material sheet to carry both shear and tensile loads.","['248/663.', '73/865.3', '73/866.4', '434/34.', '248/908.', '248/659.', '248/661.']","['Y10S248/908', 'G01M99/00']",['G01M99/00'],"['US-3344673-A', 'US-3516179-A', 'US-4114765-A', 'US-3936682-A', 'US-4148453-A', 'US-3583749-A', 'US-4562430-A', 'US-3449843-A', 'US-3923165-A', 'US-4730797-A', 'US-4803413-A', 'US-5110294-A', 'US-3281964-A', 'US-4146162-A', 'US-5022708-A', 'US-5020357-A', 'US-4619142-A', 'US-3161988-A']",",",True

An electric field oriented toward said second layer is induced through the photoactive body by virtue of the difference in chemical potential between the first and second layers of ionically conductive material. An electronically conductive body is disposed on the side of the first layer opposite from the photoactive body. The first layer in conjunction with the electronically conductive body acts as the positive electrode, the second layer acts as the negative electrode, and the photoactive body disposed therebetween acts as a solid electrolyte in the battery. When the photoactive body is exposed to visible light, it generates positive ions which are attracted to the negative electrode and electrons which are trapped by the electronically conductive body of the composite positive electrode. Charging of the battery thereby occurs as a result of the reaction between the photoactive body and light photons. During discharge of the battery, positive ions leave the negative electrode and enter the solid electrolyte comprising the photoactive body.","['429/111.', '136/253.']","['H01G9/20', 'H01L31/04', 'Y02E10/50']","['H01L31/04', 'H01G9/20']","['US-3057945-A', 'US-3247427-A']",",",False

In other words, there are two specific aspects to the Integrity Monitor (IM). For DGPS users, it predicts the reliability or quality of the DGPS corrections. For all users, it isolates the mobile position calculation from the effects of GPS satellite failures. The UDRE parameter, nominally output by a reference DGPS receiver, is used to communicate the DGPS quality information, and DGPS corrections are simply excluded for failed satellites.

A series of coordinate system transformations, corrected by the Kalman filter error estimator, are carried out to provide a command input to an antenna pointing servo system. The servo control system produces a servo error signal representative of a deviation in the actual direction of the antenna pointing mechanism from the command input to the servo loop as defined by the corrected aiming signal. The actual direction in which the servo control system points the antenna is compared with a reference (the actual direction to the satellite). As a result of this comparison, a pointing deviation signal representative of any offset from the intended pointing direction is generated. Because this pointing deviation signal depends upon the output of the servo control mechanism, it inherently contains any error in that output. Such error is removed by subtracting the servo error signal from the pointing deviation signal and applying the resultant difference signal to the Kalman filter error estimator.","['342/359.', '342/422.']","['H01Q1/125', 'G05D3/1454', 'H01Q1/18']","['G05D3/14', 'H01Q1/12', 'H01Q1/18']",['US-4179696-A'],"[0.0063557946, -0.07936724, -0.20201814, -0.030799245, 0.034998033, 0.01013733, 0.07297632, -0.076792374, 0.36455, -0.007038642, -0.09000208, 0.11494577, 0.22471212, -0.03242368, -0.043454655, 0.09503623, -0.041096177, 0.005821258, -0.2436869, 0.10486056, 0.0041920035, -0.12744273, -0.27661794, 0.206784, 0.021793611, 0.108629085, 0.09389173, 0.11203555, 0.15285566, 0.021657221, 0.15083508, -0.1859277, -0.36780462, 0.04578902, -0.02215692, 0.06827082, -0.026528876, -0.23263283, 0.0039474475, -0.000118459226, -0.11227199, -0.07834833, 0.02862337, 0.019514376, -0.026574623, 0.02841146, -0.0032758946, 0.074759014, -0.0057559693, -0.019980641, -0.018491667, -0.15409727, 0.0003733613, 0.1431884, -0.015047025, 0.044922844, 0.09115317, 0.048831563, -0.14643912, 0.08706448, -0.07449443, 0.025705172, -0.25698695, 0.12856016]",True

Such time standards are output by the satellite navigation receiver and are highly precise. An electronic distance meter (EDM) is included and has an EDM-transmitter for launching an out-bound signal to a distant target, and an EDM-receiver for receiving a reflected signal from the distant target. A phase measurement device is connected to the reference oscillator, and also to both the EDM-transmitter and EDM-receiver. It provides for a measurement of the difference in the number of cycles of the reference frequency between the out-bound signal and the reflected signal. A post-processor is connected, such as by radio link or floppy disk, to receive the measurement of the difference in the number of cycles of the reference frequency and the precision time standards obtained from orbiting navigation-satellite transmissions. Post-processing is then able to relate the corresponding measurements and time standards such that a distance-to-target measurement can ultimately be computed. Therefore routine calibration of the EDM is unnecessary. The measurement of the difference in the number of cycles of the reference frequency is time-tagged and stored for later retrieval to construct a time-ordered log. The precision time standards obtained from the orbiting navigation-satellite transmissions are similarly time-tagged and stored. Thus a series of distance-to-target measurement can be computed according to the order they were originally collected in the field by the EDM, as might be necessary in a legal inquiry.","['342/357.41', '342/357.47', '33/292.', '356/3.', '342/127.', '342/458.', '342/357.29', '342/357.27']","['G01C1/02', 'G01S7/4021', 'G01S19/235', 'G01S17/023', 'G01S7/497', 'G01S19/37']","['G01S19/44', 'G01S19/04', 'G01C1/02', 'G01S19/46', 'G01S1/00', 'G01S19/10']","['US-5155490-A', 'US-4717251-A', 'US-5233357-A', 'US-5689431-A', 'US-5471218-A']",",",True

362,US-6163294-A,20001219,US,22538469,Time-tagging electronic distance measurement instrument measurements to serve as legal evidence of calibration,"A combined satellite positioning and electro-optical total station system including a satellite navigation receiver and a reference oscillator with a reference frequency output that can be related to precision time standards obtained from orbiting navigation-satellite transmissions. Such time standards are output by the satellite navigation receiver and are highly precise. An electronic distance meter (EDM) is included and has an EDM-transmitter for launching an out-bound signal to a distant target, and an EDM-receiver for receiving a reflected signal from the distant target. A phase measurement device is connected to the reference oscillator, and also to both the EDM-transmitter and EDM-receiver. It provides for a measurement of the difference in the number of cycles of the reference frequency between the out-bound signal and the reflected signal. A post-processor is connected, such as by radio link or floppy disk, to receive the measurement of the difference in the number of cycles of the reference frequency and the precision time standards obtained from orbiting navigation-satellite transmissions. Post-processing is then able to relate the corresponding measurements and time standards such that a distance-to-target measurement can ultimately be computed. Therefore routine calibration of the EDM is unnecessary. The measurement of the difference in the number of cycles of the reference frequency is time-tagged and stored for later retrieval to construct a time-ordered log. The precision time standards obtained from the orbiting navigation-satellite transmissions are similarly time-tagged and stored. Thus a series of distance-to-target measurement can be computed according to the order they were originally collected in the field by the EDM, as might be necessary in a legal inquiry.","['342/357.41', '342/357.47', '33/292.', '356/3.', '342/127.', '342/458.', '342/357.29', '342/357.27']","['G01C1/02', 'G01S7/4021', 'G01S19/235', 'G01S17/023', 'G01S7/497', 'G01S19/37']","['G01S19/44', 'G01S19/04', 'G01C1/02', 'G01S19/46', 'G01S1/00', 'G01S19/10']","['US-5155490-A', 'US-4717251-A', 'US-5233357-A', 'US-5689431-A', 'US-5471218-A']","[0.09058693, 0.10116608, -0.15184355, -0.07891325, 0.06626106, -0.04319014, 0.060149696, -0.08965491, 0.15050744, -0.07951169, -0.043903552, 0.1303554, 0.26328695, 0.024287382, 0.010131889, -0.07332886, 0.13015711, -0.10288857, -0.29253194, 0.19966653, 0.16684492, -0.09960233, -0.06469356, 0.14464873, 0.00024436493, -0.03083723, 0.069233835, 0.28175226, 0.14538084, 0.06353145, 0.13192104, -0.28174594, -0.089203335, 0.01988546, 0.04108537, 0.075941786, -0.058334604, -0.115797065, -0.12528473, 0.02804943, -0.30624107, -0.16495082, 0.10031814, 0.080292016, 0.026090305, 0.10694924, 0.02214057, 0.1395434, -0.06747047, 0.08038152, -0.024549264, -0.08651735, -0.0890421, 0.14307636, -0.041143853, 0.027051214, 0.09985082, 0.11351065, -0.052368212, 0.03723386, -0.06464116, 0.16704212, -0.20867425, 0.13014425]",True

The dynamic satellite error vector and satellite clock error for each satellite are transmitted to plurality of “virtual” references stations. The virtual reference stations combine the dynamic satellite error vector and the satellite clock error with a local position to generate the local pseudorange corrections (PRC) for the observable satellites. The local pseudorange corrections can be broadcast using the well known RTCM SC-104 format to mobile GPS receivers that are within the local are of the virtual reference station.

The system records a vehicle&#39;s identification number, location, and odometer mileage transmitted via satellite to a fixed station. The location data is provided to a processor which determines an estimated route of travel by said vehicle using a routing program. The estimated route is comprised of a plurality of position segments, each position segment having a corresponding mileage and average expected speed. The route of travel may be checked for accuracy by comparing the estimated route mileage to the odometer mileage. If a significant difference is found, a diagnostic procedure is performed which attempts to correct the mismatch by evaluating alternate routes of travel. If the alternative route mileage agrees with the actual odometer miles within a predetermined threshold, the new route and associated mileage is used as the &#34;true&#34; route taken by the vehicle. The diagnostic procedure can also identify position segments where the vehicle appeared to be traveling much slower or faster than the average speed for that position segment. The mileage difference can then be allocated proportionally to each identified suspect position segment to provide an accurate estimate of the miles driven within the predetermined jurisdiction. Once the route of travel has been verified, the mileage traveled by the vehicle can be accurately determined and used for various computations. For example, state fuel-taxes may be accurately calculated from the mileage information.","['701/410.', '701/420.', '342/357.74', '701/468.', '342/357.3', '342/357.33', '342/357.69']","['G01S5/02', 'G08G1/127', 'H04B7/18554', 'G01C21/28', 'G01C22/02', 'G01S1/24']","['H04B7/185', 'G01S5/14', 'G01S5/02', 'G08G1/127', 'G01C21/28', 'G01C22/02', 'G01S1/24']","['US-5017926-A', 'WO-9514909-A1', 'US-5682133-A', 'US-5359528-A', 'US-5541845-A', 'US-5068656-A', 'DE-4402614-A1', 'EP-0825418-A2', 'US-5767804-A', 'US-5787383-A', 'US-5648768-A', 'US-5694322-A', 'US-5751245-A', 'US-5422815-A', 'US-5699255-A', 'WO-9636018-A1']","[0.05713803, 0.08203708, -0.014060782, -0.105872706, -0.17418748, 0.12075744, 0.016462935, 0.055265605, 0.16125886, 0.10200146, -0.07682204, 0.23077263, 0.15026778, -0.10123108, 0.100546636, 0.11772873, 0.11397152, -0.02815011, -0.26179504, 0.11864934, 0.2575444, -0.0197098, -0.027213039, -0.018966367, -0.07977948, -0.007889829, 0.025982548, 0.16634622, 0.09409602, -0.09200116, -0.03362516, -0.02552317, -0.0071885097, -0.079941444, 0.0055683698, -0.037780944, 0.07875449, -0.25328055, -0.040106013, 0.00247138, -0.15722924, -0.20441754, 0.059322674, 0.22486217, 0.10260174, -0.07898512, 0.07346571, 0.029089712, -0.007991147, 0.15210623, -0.12416874, 0.095045015, 0.114396766, 0.11151166, 0.25581986, 0.08217922, 0.14221331, 0.20911594, -0.15064816, -0.05667821, -0.113617875, 0.23042436, -0.06477162, 0.17606428]",True

The high accuracy vehicle navigation system is highly demanded for advanced AGVs. Although high positioning accuracy is achievable by a high performance RTK-GPS receiver, the performance should be considerably degraded in a high-blockage environment due to tall buildings and other obstacles. The present navigation system is to provide decimeter-level positioning accuracy in such a severe environment for precise GPS positioning. The horizontal navigation system is composed of a low cost Fiber Optic Gyro (FOG) and a precise odometer. The navigation errors are estimated using a tightly coupled Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

In a mobile unit, such as a CDMA device, a correlation pulse is generated when a transmitted code matches a stored reference code. In the absence of multipath effects, correlation pulses are generated in response to the detection of multiple transmissions of the reference code from multiple transmitters. However, multipath effects distort the generated correlation pulses leading to errors in the time of arrival measurements. The present invention calculates the width of the correlation pulses and determines a delay correction factor based on the pulse width. The delay correction factor is added to the measured delay time to provide a more accurate delay time, thus permitting more accurate location measurements based on time of arrival.

Instead, a dedicated high precision clock is used for the purpose of establishing both the outlink carrier and the return channel carrier. The modulation of the data on the outlink carrier is also derived from the precision clock source. At each remote station, the outlink channel is monitored to recover the high precision clock. This recovered clock is then used as a reference for generating the return channel carrier. The burst demodulator equipment at the master station monitors both the outlink channel continuous carrier and burst mode transmissions from the remote stations. Each of the continuous and burst mode carriers, having been transmitted through the satellite, will undergo the same frequency offset or modification, so that the frequency difference between the outlink channel carrier and the return link channel carrier will always be constant. The outlink channel carrier, which is available on a continuous basis, is used to derive a local oscillator frequency reference for establishing the burst demodulator&#39;s local oscillator reference.","['370/316.', '455/10.', '455/13.2', '455/504.']",['H04L27/2271'],"['H04B7/212', 'H04L27/227']","['US-4703479-A', 'US-4748622-A', 'US-4509200-A', 'US-4554672-A']",",",True

The first form is a commonly used approach in which regions are grown by merging the most similar spatially adjacent regions. The second form is a unique approach in which regions are grown by also merging spatially non-adjacent regions that are at least as similar as the spatially adjacent regions merged by the first form in the same iteration. The improved HSEG algorithm limits the regions considered for non-adjacent region merging in the second form of operation to regions having at least a minimum number of pixels. This minimum is dynamically controlled to optimize processing efficiency and image segmentation quality.",['382/173.'],"['G06T7/187', 'G06K9/0063', 'G06T2207/10036', 'G06T2207/10032', 'G06T7/11']",['G06K9/34'],['US-8233712-B2'],",",False

The lifting body is oriented so as to provide a horizontal force upon the satellite through the tether tension, thereby changing the orbital plane of the satellite. The tether is wound on a reel in the satellite, which may be the NASA Space Shuttle, and the lifting body may be repeatedly deployed and retrieved. The lifting body is provided with remotely controlled aerodynamic surfaces to control its angle of attack.","['244/1.TD', '244/164.', '244/158.2']",['B64G1/648'],['B64G1/64'],"['US-3560912-A', 'US-3373994-A', 'US-1218586-A', 'US-3241142-A', 'US-3582016-A', 'US-4083520-A', 'US-3613626-A', 'US-4097010-A', 'US-3389877-A']","[0.14863162, -0.17181154, 0.106435545, -0.049629632, 0.01580431, -0.036661964, -0.0060333707, -0.0142084425, 0.2150865, -0.10310975, -0.05286396, 0.1553718, 0.17425492, -0.03239711, 0.15944935, 0.14854752, 0.12094246, 0.13402173, -0.17126858, 0.2220222, 0.005702426, -0.081950955, -0.35574472, -0.053853687, 0.3425702, -0.16029276, 0.01688134, -0.010775155, 0.02922034, -0.05701091, 0.10050034, -0.14813715, -0.13180034, 0.15027383, -0.13667704, 0.16939329, 0.13073598, -0.16628622, -0.07454939, 0.08407988, -0.08083237, -0.04906145, 0.08240937, -0.13858534, -0.10178875, 0.031533416, 0.11079185, 0.120341904, -0.06487675, -0.013952639, -0.05660208, -0.2059849, 0.052101396, 0.006878346, 0.023328912, -0.1229222, 0.027438711, 0.035220675, 0.10508294, 0.10103025, 0.08628158, 0.056477528, -0.14717405, 0.035719115]",True

465,US-6389333-B1,20020514,US,25396481,Integrated flight information and control system,"An improved navigation and display system especially suitable for small aircraft rapidly determines the attitude (roll and pitch) of an aircraft from measurements made by an inexpensive, single receiver and antenna responsive to signals obtained from a satellite positioning system, e.g., the Global Positioning System. In contrast to conventional attitude navigation systems, which determine and display conventional (body-axis referenced) pitch angle, the present system determines and displays the “pseudo-attitude” or stability axis roll and pitch (flight path) angle, so that the pilot has an instantaneous comprehension of the actual flight path angle of the aircraft without needing to correct for angle of attack as in conventional attitude information systems. A Kalman filter with a short (˜0.5 second) time constant provides data at a sufficient rate (e.g., ˜10 Hz) to enable real-time flight with the system. With the additional availability of measured or estimated angle of attack, this system can also display conventional roll and pitch attitude angles. The pseudo-attitude data is incorporated into an integrated flight information system which derives all its data from the single GPS sensor and which presents all the information needed for navigation and control of the aircraft in which it is mounted.","['701/480.', '701/487.', '701/4.', '701/3.', '701/14.']","['G01S19/53', 'G01S2205/003', 'G01C23/00']","['G01C23/00', 'G01S19/39', 'G01S19/14', 'G01S5/14']","['US-5451963-A', 'US-5948045-A', 'US-5185610-A', 'US-4244215-A', 'US-5438337-A', 'US-5311194-A', 'US-5506588-A', 'US-5451964-A', 'US-5406489-A', 'US-5594453-A', 'US-5144318-A', 'US-5101356-A', 'US-5402347-A', 'WO-9608730-A1', 'US-5357263-A', 'US-5296861-A', 'US-5548293-A', 'US-5523761-A', 'US-5708583-A', 'US-5021792-A', 'US-4405986-A', 'US-4006870-A', 'US-5534875-A', 'US-5416712-A', 'US-5471509-A']","[0.12543134, -0.036960583, 0.031519275, -0.1268575, 0.015122886, -0.022779774, 0.07795017, 0.108525045, 0.2193311, 0.09930934, -0.1621885, 0.23214334, 0.1825646, -0.1137397, 0.06704655, 0.17522638, 0.057554815, -0.02842126, -0.32574478, 0.12692237, 0.11316506, -0.027526964, -0.247159, 0.03085093, 0.09982434, 0.03906974, 0.06830661, 0.16229124, 0.048521217, 0.060826667, 0.18863247, -0.14166802, -0.17480887, -0.06945324, -0.04289991, 0.1105113, 0.103554435, -0.2572225, -0.0014868971, 0.09212359, -0.21784915, -0.21623708, -0.03290246, -0.016614955, -0.0808667, 0.019088572, 0.11253016, 0.06558037, -0.061440334, 0.036928497, -0.039390862, -0.21264604, -0.0153354, 0.036255747, 0.02358864, -0.003356277, 0.084182225, 0.23602661, -0.03979918, 0.09353385, -0.09086033, 0.14663936, -0.04519189, 0.09071773]",True

The output vector of the filter includes estimates of attitude misalignments and estimates of gyro drifts corresponding to the axes of the inertial measurement unit. The optical assembly includes a sensor array providing signals to the filter representing detection of the Earth&#39;s horizon or the center of the Sun. More particularly, a local vertical vector, computed from fore and aft detections of the Earth&#39;s horizon, is used in combination with GPS received signals to initially determine attitude by means of gyrocompassing. This attitude information is thereafter maintained by the inertial measurement unit and azimuth error resulting from drift of the inertial measurement unit and the initial gyrocompassing error is corrected by detections of the Earth&#39;s horizon and the Sun. The integrated optical assembly, used to detect the locations of both the Sun and Earth relative to the satellite, eliminates a need for separate apparatus dedicated to each sensing function. Moreover, the GPS receiver eliminates the need for ground tracking apparatus by providing the satellite ephemerides (including orbital pitch rate used in gyrocompassing) for use by the filter, rendering the attitude sensing system substantially autonomous. Additionally, the GPS receiver, in combination with the Sun and Earth detections, eliminates the need for a complex star tracker by providing an accurate inertial frame of reference.","['244/164.', '701/531.', '244/171.', '701/13.', '342/357.36']","['G01S19/53', 'G01S3/7862', 'G01S19/47']","['G01S19/53', 'G01S5/14', 'G01S5/02']","['US-4521855-A', 'US-5109346-A', 'US-4837699-A', 'US-5062051-A', 'US-5412574-A', 'US-4754280-A', 'US-4617634-A', 'US-4807835-A', 'US-5020744-A', 'US-4728061-A', 'US-4883244-A', 'US-4944587-A', 'US-4786018-A']","[0.031945545, -0.07423409, -0.11668414, -0.021282243, 0.037797727, -0.041737285, 0.031978495, -0.0142826075, 0.17012702, 0.022827175, -0.18528293, 0.19700593, 0.1679975, -0.07550983, 0.09218974, 0.08140377, 0.046161935, 0.017996209, -0.23067366, 0.114428036, 0.10342615, -0.076341614, -0.24059644, 0.22455172, 0.105428144, 0.058622226, 0.15726538, 0.20345087, 0.07787253, 0.08368267, 0.17032747, -0.326319, -0.19580628, 0.09030569, -0.06214324, 0.108851895, 0.019128308, -0.15699145, -0.01707612, 0.13089505, -0.11488216, -0.17296137, 0.04936256, 0.060139526, -0.038530942, -0.049340423, 0.014135806, 0.06375146, 0.00019087495, -0.009169945, -0.06217666, -0.14173305, -0.09754213, 0.16222316, -0.0025858132, -0.10858316, 0.25727803, 0.13070306, -0.09271716, 0.051104564, -0.11468631, 0.077581525, -0.13083589, 0.18995313]",True

Corrective signals resulting from these multiplications are proportional to spatial coordinates of the tracked object in a predetermined Cartesian system, one of whose axes coincides with that of the waveguide section, and serve to keep the antenna trained upon the object.

The satellite antenna of the present invention can be installed on top of (or embedded into) the roof of a vehicle. The antenna is capable of providing high gain and a narrow antenna beam for aiming at a satellite direction and enabling broadband communication to vehicle. The present invention provides a vehicle mounted satellite antenna which has low axial ratio, high efficiency and has low grating lobes gain. The vehicle mounted satellite antenna of the present invention provides two simultaneous polarization states. In one embodiment, a hybrid mechanic and electronic steering approach provides a more reasonable cost and performance trade-off. The antenna aiming in the elevation direction is achieved via control of an electronic beamforming network. The antenna is mounted on a rotatable platform under mechanical steering and motion control for aiming the antenna in the azimuth direction. Such approach significantly reduces the complexity and increases the reliability of the mechanical design. The antenna height is compatible to the two-dimensional electronic steering phased-array antenna. Additionally, the number of the electronic processing elements required is considerably reduced from that of the conventional two-dimensional electronic steering phased-array antenna, thereby allowing for low cost and large volume commercial production. The present invention provides electronically generated left, right, up, and down beams for focusing the antenna beam toward the satellite while the vehicle is moving. All of the beams are simultaneously available for use in the motion beam tracking. This provides much faster response and less signal degradation.","['343/771.', '342/375.', '343/713.']","['G01S3/42', 'H01Q21/005', 'H01Q3/04', 'G01S3/40', 'G01S3/14', 'H01Q1/3275']","['G01S3/42', 'H01Q3/04', 'H01Q1/32', 'G01S3/40', 'G01S3/14', 'H01Q13/10', 'H01Q21/00']","['US-5961092-A', 'US-5982333-A', 'US-6124832-A', 'US-6201507-B1', 'US-6191734-B1', 'US-6653981-B2', 'US-3503073-A', 'US-6545647-B1', 'US-6861996-B2', 'US-6657589-B2', 'US-3987454-A', 'US-6028562-A', 'US-5579019-A', 'US-6049306-A', 'US-6127985-A', 'US-2003080898-A1', 'US-5398035-A', 'US-2003083063-A1', 'US-2003080907-A1']","[-0.15337723, -0.029857008, -0.13334836, 0.056744885, 0.022714024, 0.0405342, -0.14752719, -0.16687751, 0.18521929, -0.26005173, 0.054249614, 0.068201624, -0.07489967, -0.1219424, -0.017304165, 0.007902757, 0.05438071, 0.17539367, -0.21489306, 0.21836323, -0.10568593, -0.023383867, -0.17261189, 0.26071125, 0.068267755, -0.1352989, 0.019650968, 0.1257198, 0.09580529, -0.075117916, 0.025964145, -0.13981974, -0.08536189, 0.041010007, 0.009297046, -0.009528204, 0.113761306, -0.27444863, -0.068974875, 0.094576955, -0.09767656, 0.08794581, 0.11463717, -0.1013006, -0.013626868, 0.13796812, 0.089474134, 0.16280617, -0.13370954, -0.06896255, -0.2581629, 0.08507571, -0.2649997, 0.03552505, -0.029008947, 0.011076074, 0.17900832, -0.018417358, 0.011386311, -0.044172503, -0.11138335, 0.11705708, -0.15302697, 0.05187971]",True

Each subsidiary station in turn responds by transmitting a local transmit reference burst to enable synchronization of the local transmit clocks. In order to assure that the synchronous operation of the network will continue when the reference station experiences a failure, an alternate reference station is designated in the network which will assume the role of the primary reference station in a baton passing operation in the event that the existing primary reference station must abdicate its reference role. An improved method and apparatus for carrying out the baton passing operation monitors the channel error rate at the reference station and the alternate station. The error rate is measured by detecting FEC from assessing the error syndromes in the reference bursts from the reference station as received at the reference and alternate stations. This refined monitoring technique is combined with the coarser technique of monitoring the number of negative acknowledgement signals from the subsidiary stations indicating that they have not correctly received reference bursts, to yield a more refined determination at the reference station of its effectiveness as a reference station. The alternate station uses a similar technique to determine if it is sufficiently healthy to play the role of alternate station.","['370/226.', '370/324.']",['H04B7/2128'],['H04B7/212'],"['US-3878339-A', 'US-4004225-A', 'US-3761814-A']","[-0.13169304, 0.016647667, -0.09730974, -0.1134635, -9.1197595e-05, 0.011223178, 0.14938998, 0.059890017, 0.17594439, -0.023939319, -0.056839604, 0.034773454, -0.112712786, -0.076139785, 0.0702252, 0.13587278, 0.30829796, -0.07735153, -0.39175898, 0.03885109, 0.14022048, -0.07221289, -0.14098023, 0.018957725, -0.035013754, 0.13690484, 0.10238348, 0.22166768, 0.07384349, -0.08450768, -0.1593703, -0.18565597, -0.07763987, 0.094707854, -0.043629132, -0.009816456, -0.046817306, -0.08939343, 0.03401061, 0.11053122, -0.029595995, 0.08161407, -0.07134333, -0.018931163, 0.07720156, 0.0020714132, 0.067592494, 0.024567805, -0.056269273, 0.09628946, -0.2035143, 0.020347094, 0.12246795, -0.026640434, 0.05718948, -0.010074341, 0.105852075, -0.10724747, -0.14273113, 0.20979995, 0.10042044, 0.32098886, -0.1841571, 0.17553806]",True

The method further includes the steps of transmitting the correction signal to the satellite; and correcting the attitude of the satellite in accordance with the correction signal.,"['244/164.', '342/354.', '455/12.1', '701/501.', '342/358.', '342/355.']","['B64G1/363', 'B64G1/366', 'B64G1/1007', 'B64G1/365', 'B64G1/24', 'B64G3/00', 'H04B7/2041', 'B64G1/66', 'G05D1/0883']","['H04B7/216', 'H04B7/195', 'G05D1/08', 'B64G1/36', 'B64G1/24', 'B64G3/00', 'B64G1/10', 'H04B7/204', 'B64G1/66']","['US-4901307-A', 'US-5446756-A', 'US-5239671-A', 'US-5010317-A', 'US-5339330-A', 'US-5439190-A', 'US-5070338-A', 'EP-0421698-A2', 'US-4567485-A', 'WO-9013186-A1', 'US-5448623-A', 'US-4599619-A', 'US-5303286-A', 'WO-9109473-A1', 'US-RE32905-E', 'US-4630058-A', 'US-4910524-A', 'US-5119225-A', 'US-4910792-A', 'US-5433726-A', 'US-5073900-A', 'US-5081703-A', 'US-5233626-A', 'US-5410728-A', 'US-5216427-A', 'US-RE32905-F1', 'US-5109390-A', 'US-5422647-A']","[0.058552504, -0.06718203, -0.11377914, 0.078102216, 0.10078956, 0.09341181, -0.07904419, -0.056613717, 0.11532694, -0.09744769, -0.2519384, 0.10509061, 0.105757885, -0.1393732, 0.1105717, 0.15904908, 0.13184696, 0.040374596, -0.26932704, 0.1366834, 0.07206288, -0.12696631, -0.10225264, 0.12111172, 0.12288269, -0.07796771, 0.04287126, 0.10904735, 0.17277712, -0.06665972, 0.09803984, -0.28178287, -0.2533015, 0.07152486, -0.10092915, 0.07184998, -0.0012555657, -0.30629072, -0.08996667, 0.0877611, -0.12052274, -0.015163082, 0.07450088, -0.027081048, -0.011638626, 0.02589189, 0.10841749, 0.20792566, -0.02827316, 0.006202345, -0.16574228, -0.03470976, 0.0014043591, 0.096468106, 0.02261232, -0.17082824, 0.1568199, 0.04158134, -0.1740354, 0.053127903, -0.043400083, 0.16796587, -0.1857089, 0.027202722]",True

The sets of zenith delay values for corresponding grid points are compared in the server ( 260 ) and modifications developed (preferably in fractional form) by which the non-meteorological delay values require correcting to be accurate. The correction sets are reduced by image compression techniques ( 270 ) and transmitted via the satellites ( 110   1  etc) of the GNSS at low data rate to the user receiver, which receiver simply applies the corrections to the Zenith delays derived by its own model. If a user position is known, the server may derive accurate tropospheric delay values directly for the receiver position directly for transmission.","['701/469.', '342/357.28']","['G01S19/40', 'G01S5/009', 'G01S19/41', 'G01S19/07']","['G01S19/41', 'G01S5/02', 'G01S19/40', 'G01S19/07', 'G01S19/05', 'G01S1/00', 'G01S5/00', 'G01S19/10']","['US-2002199196-A1', 'US-2001026239-A1', 'US-5323322-A', 'US-5828336-A', 'US-2005001742-A1']","[0.012732934, 0.006031053, -0.055269293, 0.069347195, 0.05710662, -0.07867518, -9.610048e-05, -0.16921973, 0.18291034, -0.04083008, -0.053452857, 0.12861662, 0.09501789, 0.028611071, 0.030137643, 0.1464144, 0.07852546, 0.07688731, -0.20134182, 0.14687926, 0.17771043, -0.014899806, -0.016248535, 0.083968, -0.044152547, -0.056103233, 0.10905563, 0.19144318, 0.1352921, 0.0471406, 0.17393327, -0.05804501, -0.20119435, -0.062885575, -0.03315763, 0.028981928, -0.040149022, -0.2666323, -0.05153507, 0.110397376, -0.36707556, -0.13488778, 0.07421424, 0.0570396, -0.11406382, -0.120666035, 0.06056521, 0.19089249, -0.056264624, 0.092683904, -0.16189978, -0.13907605, 0.0055196537, 0.19765387, 0.13003328, -0.0059897746, 0.18502003, 0.073063865, -0.18867695, 0.049435444, -0.047093134, 0.2706975, -0.12625547, 0.018401155]",True

For a fine correcting of the off-course signal, the output signals of the earth horizon sensor which can be assigned to an earth rim with higher temperature, and those which can be assigned to the other oppositely located earth rim with lower temperature, are attenuated or amplified, respectively, in such a way, in dependence on a correction signal taking into account the earth anomaly, that the amplitude changes of the off-course signal caused by the earth anomaly are cancelled.","['250/347.', '250/338.1', '250/351.', '250/342.']","['G01S3/787', 'G01S3/781', 'G01S3/7868']","['G01S3/786', 'G01S3/787', 'B64G1/36', 'G01S3/781']","['US-3714432-A', 'US-3551681-A', 'US-3486024-A', 'US-3920994-A', 'DE-3322750-A1']","[0.080155104, 0.018882655, -0.20711854, -0.073963895, 0.10257991, 0.07546662, 0.059160747, -0.055357654, 0.16862017, -0.067433715, -0.043863155, 0.12273973, 0.17304464, -0.16066535, 0.24152187, 0.06793069, 0.12679791, 0.0001067217, -0.10043399, 0.07598903, 0.12851007, -0.147421, -0.13774602, 0.12060762, 0.10798934, -0.116407275, 0.1819535, 0.20479156, -0.04126813, -0.0011632963, 0.14973564, -0.36430907, -0.23094086, 0.013065618, 0.028994096, 0.013320042, 0.039261438, -0.09534021, 0.022292048, 0.083071046, -0.00064011477, -0.1013518, 0.022303501, 0.03645142, 0.11741416, -0.0031104505, -0.06295302, 0.06066961, -0.06381008, -0.03897363, -0.0354239, -0.21618101, -0.11597332, 0.15256114, 0.072091, -0.048912786, 0.19236502, 0.049598966, -0.10224956, 0.083805166, -0.13457566, 0.2630653, -0.1732142, 0.11973888]",True

In one embodiment, a momentum bias satellite is in an orbit slightly inclined from the geostationary orbit. The desired angular momentum vector attitude is chosen based on the orbit, the desired payload attitude, and the gimbal capabilities, and executed using thrusters. This reorientation limits the required gimbal travel. Based on this information, time-varying payload offsets in yaw, pitch and roll are computed from the nominal attitude produced by nulling earth sensor errors in roll and pitch, and using momentum bias and yaw estimation to control yaw. These offsets are implemented by a 3-axis gimbal between the momentum bias and the payload.

650,US-6084989-A,20000704,US,25015267,System and method for automatically determining the position of landmarks in digitized images derived from a satellite-based imaging system,"A system and method for determining offset errors between line and pixel coordinates of landmarks in a digitized image generated by an imaging system disposed on a spacecraft and line and pixel coordinates predicted by a mathematical model of the imaging system using landmark geodetic coordinates on the Earth. The system and method use landmarks in symbolic form, such as perimeters of lakes and islands that are stored in a database. A digitized image generated by the satellite-based imaging system is processed to extract a patch of the image containing a landmark. The image patch is then upsampled (magnified). The landmark boundary is processed using a mathematical model of the imaging system to generate absolute coordinates of the boundary pixels, which are upsampled and rasterized to produce a landmark mask. The landmark mask and the upsampled image patch are then processed by one or more matching algorithms to generate line and pixel offset error values indicative of the offset between the predicted position of the landmark and the actual position of the landmark in the image. A match figure of merit is also generated that is indicative of the reliability and accuracy of the computed offset. Optionally, the upsampled image patch is processed using an image enhancement algorithm that increases the contrast and robustness of the images by converting pixel gray scale values into likelihood ratios.","['382/103.', '382/109.', '382/298.', '382/293.', '382/213.', '382/203.', '382/106.', '382/190.', '382/108.', '382/201.', '382/181.', '382/217.', '348/144.', '382/199.', '382/209.', '382/295.', '701/514.', '382/299.', '382/204.']","['G06T2207/10032', 'G06T7/33']",['G06T7/00'],"['US-5596494-A', 'US-5625409-A', 'US-5612901-A', 'US-5093869-A', 'US-5275354-A', 'US-5179638-A']","[0.03961393, -0.048755664, -0.15110758, -0.08951729, 0.038211484, -0.001273673, -0.019220116, -0.09592631, 0.18096524, 0.10503978, -0.155729, 0.21798827, 0.11720822, -0.06829987, -0.00011194639, 0.09153167, -0.064702064, 0.16653925, -0.044190675, 0.27693748, 0.06593015, 0.017649963, -0.13895267, 0.13453601, -0.016493717, -0.022519778, 0.1939058, 0.10845439, 0.122068055, 0.007993518, 0.14911667, -0.16055083, -0.20031956, -0.06514092, 0.009211788, 0.008355027, 0.05010111, -0.10056066, 0.07381555, -0.021806527, -0.29920378, -0.13550293, -0.07722955, 0.101254724, -0.07920298, -0.12291285, 0.083525494, 0.107722595, 0.0838485, -0.08177973, -0.05363254, -0.067550234, -0.14269046, 0.11733495, 0.006730576, 0.08277588, 0.19579527, 0.20972121, -0.24125557, 0.09103167, -0.15440726, 0.13658778, -0.12999088, 0.22037402]",True

A receiver in the system includes a directional antenna that is focused on the signals transmitted by the geostationary satellite. The antenna rejects multipath signals, and the receiver thus tracks the satellite signal directly, without having to compensate for multipath distortion. Once the receiver is tracking the code and carrier, the receiver decodes the transmitted data to recover timing information, as well as satellite orbital correction information and an ionospheric model, or table, transmitted by the satellite. The receiver then uses the decoded information and timing pulses provided in synchronism with the transmitted PRN code to produce a corrected timing signal. The timing signal is provided to drive a reference clock that produces a system time signal that is essentially as stable as the Cesium clock signals utilized by the WAAS system.","['342/357.48', '701/469.', '342/357.42']","['G01S19/215', 'G01S19/235']","['G01S19/11', 'G01S1/00', 'G01S19/05']","['US-H1618-H', 'US-5621646-A', 'US-5623414-A', 'US-5731786-A', 'US-5736960-A', 'US-5760738-A', 'US-4704735-A', 'US-5036523-A', 'US-5952960-A', 'US-4336542-A', 'US-4445118-A']",",",True

The GPS search modes have different coherent integration lengths and different degrees of sensitivity. After detection, measurements are logged into a database for further processing. Several cross-correlation tests are described. For example, a “Mainlobe” cross-correlation test is described that identifies the most significant cross-correlations that occur when the Doppler difference between the interfering SV signal and the target SV signal is nonzero and a multiple of 1 kHz. Appropriate C/No and Doppler thresholds, or masks, are selected and used to identify the mainlobe cross-correlations. A wide Doppler mask is used to account for the effects on cross-correlations caused by BPSK data bit modulation. Appropriate MS-Assisted and MS-Based cross-correlation masks are described.

679,US-8542146-B2,20130924,US,40591689,Generalized partial fixing,"Described is a generalized approach for integer parameter estimation, especially in the context of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). The problem solved is the case where a definitively correct integer solution cannot be identified for all ambiguity parameters in a reliable way. The proposed solution is to apply a linear transformation to the ambiguities (multiply with a matrix) such that the images of the first and the second candidate (or more) are identical. That way, from the first and second (and possibly more) candidates of the integer least-squares solution, a subset of ambiguity combinations is derived that can be fixed. Thus, it is no longer necessary to choose between the solutions as they coincide for the new ambiguities. The advantage of this approach is maximizing all information still available when finally deriving additional parameters such as position, clock error, atmospheric errors and/or time correlated noise. This technique is applicable to real-time and post-processing applications, as well as to pure GNSS applications, GNSS integrated with other sensors (e.g. INS) and other applications that have to resolve multiple integer ambiguities. This may also apply to optical distance-measurement. GNSS applications include kinematic and static positioning with single base stations as well as with multiple base stations or reference station networks. They also comprise the integer parameter estimation methods used within the reference station network computations.","['342/357.38', '342/357.27']",['G01S19/44'],"['G01S5/14', 'G01S19/44', 'G01S19/55']","['US-5991691-A', 'US-7538721-B2', 'US-6731701-B2', 'US-6753810-B1', 'US-6229479-B1', 'US-5914685-A', 'US-7312747-B2', 'US-7432853-B2', 'US-5825326-A', 'US-7102563-B2', 'US-6934632-B2', 'US-5610614-A', 'US-6441780-B1', 'US-7589668-B2', 'US-5572218-A']","[0.016211035, 0.044742227, -0.08737295, 0.047809105, -0.041922234, -0.08695257, -0.02428054, 0.009554937, 0.17582192, -0.0020908143, -0.20263201, 0.13348198, 0.15068537, -0.17349432, -0.0385081, 0.020252198, 0.049201977, -0.023913283, -0.25846484, 0.15378179, 0.06830342, -0.046093304, -0.061695423, 0.18099533, -0.019889073, 0.02654533, 0.12790596, 0.163534, 0.065340504, -0.07329934, 0.10472917, -0.081586495, -0.113468364, -0.07583484, -0.037873488, 0.049767926, 0.032583583, -0.18633236, 0.0071452553, 0.12905118, -0.28539634, -0.3079925, 0.08920167, -0.013189221, 0.0060630445, -0.0054021385, 0.010855579, 0.15542585, 0.051642593, 0.05788058, -0.061980672, -0.042377986, -0.120166, 0.09474883, -0.042212076, 0.15598674, 0.31427258, 0.086306214, -0.1735082, -0.016254663, -0.07728232, 0.20083001, -0.06077545, 0.3057363]",True

694,US-5528502-A,19960618,US,24283989,Satellite orbit maintenance system,"A technique for maintaining a satellite in an assigned orbit without control or intervention from the ground. Autonomously obtained navigational data provide a measurement of the actual orbit in which the satellite is traveling. So long as the measured orbit conforms to a desired orbit to within a preselected tolerance, periodic corrections of equal magnitude are made to the satellite&#39;s velocity, based on a prediction of the effect of atmospheric drag on the orbit. Measurement of the orbit is made by observation of the time that the satellite passes a reference point in the orbit, such as by crossing the ascending node. If the measured orbit departs from the desired orbit by more than the preselected tolerance, a velocity correction of a magnitude different from the one based on prediction is applied to the satellite. For a decaying orbit, the magnitude of the velocity correction is increased above the correction value based on prediction. For a rising orbit, the magnitude of the velocity correction is decreased below the value based on prediction, and may be reduced to zero, allowing atmospheric drag to bring the measured orbit back within the preselected tolerance range.","['244/158.8', '244/164.', '342/354.', '244/165.', '701/531.', '701/13.', '342/352.', '244/169.', '342/355.']","['B64G1/24', 'G05D1/0883', 'B64G1/26', 'B64G1/36']","['B64G1/24', 'G05D1/08', 'B64G1/26', 'B64G1/36']","['US-5050087-A', 'US-4161780-A', 'US-5227802-A', 'US-5267167-A', 'US-4730798-A', 'US-3944172-A', 'US-4288051-A', 'US-5222023-A', 'US-4617634-A', 'US-5326054-A', 'US-5163641-A', 'US-4358076-A', 'US-5132910-A', 'US-4958788-A', 'US-4776540-A', 'US-5054719-A', 'US-4102958-A', 'US-3866025-A', 'US-5109346-A', 'US-4837699-A', 'US-5279483-A', 'US-4599697-A', 'US-4911385-A']","[0.006348013, -0.17003855, -0.14160545, 0.044734064, 0.046007063, -0.004840187, 0.07403666, 0.049466766, 0.21805517, -0.025884978, -0.19946854, 0.18135256, 0.3039241, -0.07089608, 0.1134335, 0.13019235, 0.062810354, 0.015026854, -0.18011422, 0.12826855, -0.020103194, -0.14077824, -0.20730078, 0.045427985, 0.16263378, -0.1528587, 0.0094511155, 0.10211888, 0.17051719, 0.06532885, 0.11514077, -0.2152857, -0.24891338, 0.0967179, -0.100638665, 0.17355691, 0.1117022, -0.19099617, -0.016015442, 0.1032266, -0.10232438, -0.09795311, 0.15173683, -0.05887012, -0.09247382, 0.1053677, -0.053341378, 0.17895049, 0.08186443, -0.0041155075, -0.030224646, -0.08711942, 0.0033883164, 0.08516334, 0.091922306, -0.0811224, 0.21159708, 3.116979e-05, 0.0025402645, 0.15240952, 0.019623265, 0.072566, -0.13871196, 0.12760782]",True

The GPS signals of a known wavelength are processed digitally for a particular instant in time. A range difference or propagation delay between each antenna for GPS signals received from each satellite is first resolved. The range difference consists of a fractional wavelength difference and an integer wavelength difference. The fractional wavelength difference is determined by each antenna&#39;s tracking loop. The integer wavelength difference is based upon the known wavelength and separation between each antenna with respect to each satellite position. The range difference is then used to digitally delay the GPS signals at each antenna with respect to a reference antenna. The signal at the reference antenna is then summed with the digitally delayed signals to generate a composite antenna gain. The method searches for the correct number of integer wavelengths to maximize the composite gain.

In the past inertial sensors have been large spinning mass gyroscopes and large mass-based accelerometers. These inertial sensors have required high voltage three phase electrical supplies. The “wearable” body pack must be battery operated and the sensors must be small and lightweight. Micro-Electro-Mechanical (MEM) sensors fulfill both the requirements of low weight and low power consumption. The accuracy of the MEM sensor has been developed sufficiently to incorporate, with de-noising algorithms, an accurate position-sensing device.

A reference SATPS station is provided with known location coordinates, and pseudoranges PR(t) and pseudorange corrections ΔPR(t) for the reference station are computed as in a conventional differential GPS approach. A matrix equation H(t) ΔW(t)=ΔPR(t) relates the corrections for the spatial location coordinates and clock bias at the mobile station (or at the reference station) to the pseudorange correction values at that station, where H is an M×N matrix (M≦N; N=3 or 4) with known entries. Each of the N rows of the matrix H has M entries and forms a row vector, and these row vectors are linearly independent in an M-dimensional vector space. These row vectors span an N-dimensional vector space. The matrix H is augmented by M-N rows representing independent vectors in an M-dimensional vector space, to produce an augmented M×M matrix H*, for which an inverse H*(t) -1  exists. An augmented matrix equation ΔW*(t;mobile)=H*(t) -1  ΔPR(t) is formed, and N of the entries in the M×1 matrix ΔW*(t) are interpreted as corrections for the spatial location coordinates and/or clock bias for the mobile station. In another embodiment, an M×1 projected vector v is formed from all the uncorrected pseudorange components for the mobile station and a reduced set of these components are transmitted to the reference station. The full vector v is then reconstructed from this reduced set and used to reconstruct the mobile station uncorrected pseudorange values. Corrected mobile station pseudorange values are computed and used to determine the spatial location and clock bias coordinates for the mobile station.","['342/357.29', '701/469.']","['G01S19/41', 'G01S5/0036', 'G01S19/07']","['G01S19/29', 'G01S19/46', 'G01S5/14', 'G01S19/30', 'G01S5/00']","['US-4894662-A', 'US-5148179-A', 'US-4972431-A', 'US-4578678-A']","[-0.026059715, 0.01104508, -0.06236777, 0.06799183, 0.056728117, -0.045201298, 0.014856096, -0.07084787, 0.13434842, -0.036630172, -0.22162192, 0.116522655, 0.18843466, -0.03743156, -0.06961972, 0.06943312, 0.012739137, -0.01729212, -0.24652189, 0.16854471, 0.15142113, -0.16253024, 0.030774642, 0.08931111, -0.094271615, -0.015299999, 0.07676778, 0.18888539, 0.18547517, -0.029721277, 0.15267043, -0.17287046, -0.14116883, -0.035531487, -0.04300853, 0.13482715, 0.05059536, -0.281242, -0.041041616, 0.11973119, -0.23304647, -0.2222262, 0.12734428, 0.043823477, -0.042574633, -0.042417176, 0.028693123, 0.20015126, 0.02874151, 0.118368626, -0.10236207, -0.048989452, -0.014089237, 0.0647532, 0.06944719, -0.013981677, 0.1933659, 0.2132193, -0.1728332, 0.14523275, 0.02439461, 0.20717788, -0.18966152, 0.09375249]",True

The measure can be a size category, an average diameter or another measure, such as a shape and orientation of the cell, a boundary apex, and a boundary line of the cell. The base station coordinates are conventionally available to the receiver. By providing a measure of size, the receiver can resolve its zone or location to a coarse or low level of resolution. The zone occupied by the receiver is at least within the cell and the size of the cell and location of the base station are now known. According to additional embodiments, the resolved zone known to be occupied by the receiver is refined to an area within the defined cell area. The size of the cell or service area of the location transmitter can be appended to the identification code of the base station.

The satellite antenna of the present invention can be installed on top of (or embedded into) the roof of a vehicle. The antenna is capable of providing high gain and a narrow antenna beam for aiming at a satellite direction and enabling broadband communication to vehicle. The present invention provides a vehicle mounted satellite antenna which has low axial ratio, high efficiency and has low grating lobes gain. The vehicle mounted satellite antenna of the present invention provides two simultaneous polarization states. In one embodiment, a hybrid mechanic and electronic steering approach provides a more reasonable cost and performance trade-off. The antenna aiming in the elevation direction is achieved via control of an electronic beamforming network. The antenna is mounted on a rotatable platform under mechanical steering and motion control for aiming the antenna in the azimuth direction. Such approach significantly reduces the complexity and increases the reliability of the mechanical design. The antenna height is compatible to the two-dimensional electronic steering phased-array antenna. Additionally, the number of the electronic processing elements required is considerably reduced from that of the conventional two-dimensional electronic steering phased-array antenna, thereby allowing for low cost and large volume commercial production. The present invention provides electronically generated left, right, up, and down beams for focusing the antenna beam toward the satellite while the vehicle is moving. All of the beams are simultaneously available for use in the motion beam tracking.

So long as the measured orbit conforms to a desired orbit to within a preselected tolerance, periodic corrections of equal magnitude are made to the satellite&#39;s velocity, based on a prediction of the effect of atmospheric drag on the orbit. Measurement of the orbit is made by observation of the time that the satellite passes a reference point in the orbit, such as by crossing the ascending node. If the measured orbit departs from the desired orbit by more than the preselected tolerance, a velocity correction of a magnitude different from the one based on prediction is applied to the satellite. For a decaying orbit, the magnitude of the velocity correction is increased above the correction value based on prediction. For a rising orbit, the magnitude of the velocity correction is decreased below the value based on prediction, and may be reduced to zero, allowing atmospheric drag to bring the measured orbit back within the preselected tolerance range.","['244/164.', '342/354.', '701/531.', '701/78.', '701/4.', '244/171.', '701/13.', '342/352.', '244/167.', '244/169.']","['B64G1/24', 'G05D1/0883', 'B64G1/26', 'B64G1/36']","['B64G1/24', 'G05D1/08', 'B64G1/26', 'B64G1/36']","['US-5050087-A', 'US-4161780-A', 'US-4752884-A', 'US-5184790-A', 'US-5227802-A', 'US-5267167-A', 'US-4730798-A', 'US-3944172-A', 'US-4288051-A', 'US-5222023-A', 'US-4617634-A', 'US-5326054-A', 'US-5163641-A', 'US-4912475-A', 'US-4358076-A', 'US-5132910-A', 'US-4801940-A', 'US-4958788-A', 'US-4776540-A', 'US-4102958-A', 'US-3866025-A', 'US-5109346-A', 'US-4837699-A', 'US-5279483-A', 'US-5528502-A', 'US-4599697-A', 'US-5077561-A', 'US-5149022-A', 'US-4911385-A']",",",True

Time information acquired by a GPS satellite is corrected by ranging information of a discovery function of an OLT so as to be reflected on time information of each ONU. A propagation delay from the L2SW to the OLT is obtained with the use of a delay estimation mechanism, a propagation delay from the OLT to the ONU which is obtained by ranging is added to obtain a propagation delay from the L2SW to the ONU. The obtained propagation delay from the L2SW to the ONU is added to the transmitted time stamp value whereby a time stamp value received at a base station or femtocell side becomes a time into which the propagation delay to the ONU is incorporated, and absolute values of clock timers can be synchronized with each other. The addition process can be realized by rewriting the time stamp value of the packet within the OLT or the ONU.","['398/102.', '398/99.', '398/154.']","['H04J3/0655', 'H04J3/0673', 'H04J3/0644', 'H04J3/0682']","['H04L7/00', 'H04J3/00', 'H04J14/08', 'H04J3/06', 'H04B10/00']","['US-2012008953-A1', 'US-2009067850-A1', 'US-2013004160-A1', 'JP-2010278546-A', 'WO-2011058625-A1', 'US-2011129218-A1', 'US-2011262133-A1']",",",True

After processing the network packet at the upper layers of the stack or by the second network processing program, the first network processing program modifies the network pack in order to transmit the packet to the intended destination while traversing the intermediary.","['370/401.', '370/254.', '709/203.', '709/230.', '709/224.', '709/246.', '370/252.']","['H04L63/0236', 'H04L63/10', 'H04L45/74', 'H04L67/2804', 'H04L63/0227', 'H04L29/08729']","['H04L29/06', 'H04L29/08']","['US-6907473-B2', 'US-6339832-B1', 'US-2007057783-A1', 'US-4935870-A', 'US-6040834-A', 'US-6272148-B1', 'US-6550057-B1', 'US-2007130334-A1', 'US-7069326-B1', 'US-7188180-B2', 'US-6891881-B2', 'US-6339595-B1', 'US-6601192-B1', 'US-5898674-A', 'US-6539396-B1', 'US-5485460-A', 'US-6888844-B2', 'US-5856974-A', 'US-6496520-B1', 'US-2005083947-A1', 'US-2004015591-A1', 'WO-2004028175-A1', 'US-2006026682-A1', 'US-2008069106-A1', 'US-6606660-B1', 'US-2003051142-A1', 'US-2002141418-A1', 'US-6463470-B1', 'US-6975655-B2', 'US-4893307-A', 'US-6901072-B1', 'US-2006233168-A1', 'US-7260840-B2', 'US-5412654-A', 'US-2004268358-A1', 'US-6442748-B1', 'US-7000031-B2', 'US-7050396-B1', 'US-6161123-A', 'WO-2008112698-A2', 'US-6131120-A', 'US-6412000-B1', 'US-6954852-B2', 'US-5499343-A', 'WO-2005024567-A2', 'US-2008225720-A1', 'US-2006269053-A1', 'US-7062645-B2', 'US-5021949-A', 'US-2002032798-A1', 'US-2006029016-A1', 'US-6618397-B1', 'US-6219786-B1', 'US-2008046616-A1', 'US-5491800-A', 'US-6236652-B1', 'US-2006221990-A1', 'US-6742015-B1', 'US-5706437-A', 'US-6006264-A', 'US-2007245409-A1', 'US-2008225748-A1', 'US-6466984-B1', 'US-6529909-B1', 'US-6697849-B1', 'US-2008281908-A1', 'US-6496850-B1', 'WO-0223362-A1', 'US-6549949-B1', 'US-6640244-B1', 'US-5938733-A', 'US-7318100-B2', 'US-5548723-A', 'US-6526056-B1', 'US-2006050703-A1', 'US-6636242-B2', 'US-7102996-B1', 'US-6954800-B2', 'US-6993101-B2', 'US-6502213-B1', 'US-2004268357-A1', 'US-6434568-B1', 'US-6640248-B1', 'US-2008049786-A1', 'US-6236643-B1', 'US-6332163-B1', 'US-6877043-B2', 'US-6715145-B1', 'US-2002085631-A1', 'US-5809235-A', 'US-6640249-B1', 'US-6718380-B1', 'US-6842906-B1', 'US-7353533-B2', 'US-5572528-A', 'US-5515508-A', 'US-2005021949-A1', 'US-6289382-B1', 'US-5987517-A', 'US-6502135-B1', 'US-6988193-B2', 'WO-2006074072-A2', 'US-4941089-A', 'US-6529948-B1', 'US-5426637-A', 'US-5802306-A', 'US-2003208675-A1', 'US-2004210320-A1', 'US-2007086356-A1', 'US-7385924-B1', 'US-2003198189-A1', 'US-6760775-B1', 'US-6834310-B2', 'US-6615199-B1', 'US-6640238-B1', 'US-2003182431-A1', 'US-6882634-B2', 'US-5968176-A', 'US-6477580-B1', 'US-2003206554-A1', 'US-5448561-A', 'US-6233619-B1', 'US-6418324-B1', 'US-6601234-B1', 'US-2008034416-A1', 'US-2006112185-A1', 'US-2003093566-A1', 'US-6816963-B1', 'US-7054944-B2', 'US-6078582-A', 'US-2005265351-A1', 'US-7389462-B1', 'US-2004202171-A1', 'US-6477665-B1', 'US-6839759-B2', 'US-2005013280-A1', 'US-5446736-A', 'US-6988236-B2', 'US-2009024763-A1', 'US-2002105942-A1', 'US-7221660-B1', 'US-6198920-B1', 'US-6615253-B1', 'WO-2006051148-A1', 'WO-0232073-A2', 'US-6894981-B1', 'US-6182139-B1', 'US-7313613-B1', 'US-2001030970-A1', 'US-5764915-A', 'US-2007156852-A1', 'US-2008320151-A1', 'US-6826616-B2', 'US-5548726-A', 'US-2004087304-A1', 'US-7096495-B1', 'US-6324582-B1', 'WO-2006012612-A1', 'US-6434628-B1', 'US-7136645-B2', 'US-2002165990-A1', 'US-5757795-A', 'US-6760748-B1', 'US-2005002417-A1', 'US-2006002370-A1', 'US-2007008883-A1', 'US-6553377-B1', 'US-2002071438-A1', 'US-6452915-B1', 'US-2003131079-A1', 'US-2008225753-A1', 'US-2003200290-A1', 'US-7200153-B2', 'US-2008229381-A1', 'US-7512702-B1', 'US-7321936-B2', 'US-6973097-B1', 'US-6158007-A', 'WO-0147185-A2', 'US-7313735-B1', 'US-5627829-A', 'US-2003123481-A1', 'US-6785237-B1', 'US-2007160063-A1', 'US-6571282-B1', 'US-5440719-A', 'US-6438594-B1', 'US-7420992-B1', 'US-6898204-B2', 'US-7363347-B2', 'US-6101543-A', 'US-2002098840-A1', 'US-7035285-B2', 'US-6578068-B1', 'US-2004081180-A1', 'US-5796727-A', 'US-2003161341-A1', 'US-6618761-B2', 'US-2003079040-A1']",",",False

At the moon, the satellite is in the so-called fuzzy boundary or weak stability age boundary. A negligibly small maneuver can then bring it back to the Earth on a reverse BCT to the desired Earth inclination. Another maneuver puts it into the new ellipse at the earth. In the case of satellites launched from Vandenberg AFB into LEO in a circular orbit of an altitude of 700 km with an inclination of 34°, approximately 6 km/s is required to change the inclination to 90°. The previous flight time associated with this method was approximately 170 days. A modification of this method also achieves a significant savings and unexpected benefits in energy as measured by Delta-V, where the flight time is also substantially reduced to 88 or even 6 days.","['244/158.5', '701/531.', '701/13.']","['B64G1/007', 'B64G1/242', 'B64G2001/247']","['B64G1/24', 'B64G1/00', 'B64G1/10', 'G05D1/10']","['US-5158249-A', 'US-5199672-A', 'US-3676581-A', 'US-3532298-A', 'US-5506780-A', 'US-5507454-A', 'US-5120008-A', 'US-5421540-A', 'US-6059233-A', 'US-5067672-A', 'US-4288051-A', 'US-T100604-I4', 'US-5433726-A', 'US-5163640-A', 'US-4618112-A', 'US-5568904-A', 'US-5681011-A', 'US-4599697-A', 'US-5595360-A', 'US-5452869-A', 'US-5064152-A']",",",True

A complete initialization is forced to occur. The test program uninitializes the RTK solution by causing a loss of integer ambiguities resolution by forcing a loss of lock on one or more satellites. The test program then monitors the subsequent initialization process, e.g., the time needed to search for phase ambiguity candidates, discovering the prevalent satellite geometry, determination of whether the correct ambiguity candidate was found, finding the ratio of the second best to best solution variances of the ambiguity candidates in the list throughout the candidate propagation process or similar statistical test, computing the RMS error of the solution at the time that initialization was declared and after initialization, and calculating the baseline vector between the rover and base at the time of initialization and after initialization.

This presence signal, or a reference signal produced from the presence signal and the amount of the corrected off-course signal (|U DO  |), respectively, are used in order to draw the characteristic line of the earth-horizon sensor into the desired characteristic line of the earth-horizon sensor, also during a &#34;off-pointing&#34;, by controlling the amplification factor for the detector output signal, which is applicable for the instance when the line of sight of the earth-horizon sensor, which line of sight is fixed with respect to the satellite, is aligned with the earth central point.","['250/351.', '250/338.1', '250/347.', '250/342.']","['G01S3/787', 'G01S3/7868', 'G01S3/781']","['G01S3/786', 'G01S3/787', 'B64G1/36', 'G01S3/781']","['US-3714432-A', 'US-3551681-A', 'US-3486024-A', 'US-3920994-A', 'US-3638021-A']",",",True

The hybrid gateway intercepts requests made by the requesting terminals and, if necessary, reduces the advertized window size of requests made by the requesting terminal, thereby reducing the transmission speed of the link and therefore the bandwidth of the link.","['709/223.', '709/225.', '709/250.']","['H04L2212/00', 'H04L12/5692', 'H04L69/168', 'H04B7/18584', 'H04L43/00', 'H04L69/16', 'H04L69/163', 'H04L47/70', 'H04L12/2856', 'H04L47/762', 'H04L47/30', 'H04L47/15', 'H04L47/14', 'H04L47/10', 'H04L47/20', 'H04L47/824', 'H04L47/803', 'H04L47/805', 'H04L47/825', 'H04L69/169', 'H04L47/27', 'H04L69/161', 'H04L61/10', 'H04L47/748', 'H04L29/06', 'H04L47/2425', 'H04L43/0888', 'H04L29/12009', 'H04L43/16', 'H04L29/12018']","['H04B7/185', 'H04L29/06', 'G06F15/173', 'H04L12/28', 'H04L12/26', 'H04L12/56', 'H04L29/12']","['US-6222856-B1', 'US-4959872-A', 'US-5157662-A', 'US-4847892-A', 'US-6519636-B2', 'US-5038265-A', 'US-6249530-B1', 'US-4636879-A', 'US-5504814-A', 'US-6292465-B1', 'US-5465213-C1', 'US-5699369-A', 'US-6016388-A', 'US-6038216-A', 'US-5534913-A', 'US-5799002-A', 'US-6076113-A', 'US-4802215-A', 'US-5257369-A', 'US-5594776-A', 'US-5101267-A', 'US-4358672-A', 'US-5394469-A', 'US-6185619-B1', 'US-5592173-A', 'US-5303042-A', 'US-2001043609-A1', 'US-5111504-A', 'US-5548753-A', 'US-5491800-A', 'US-5481609-A', 'US-5404505-A', 'US-5590200-A', 'US-5029207-A', 'US-5237610-A', 'US-5764641-A', 'US-5465213-A', 'US-4135156-A', 'US-5564076-A', 'US-4680688-A', 'US-4724520-A', 'US-5359367-A', 'US-5953506-A', 'US-6078953-A', 'US-5426635-A', 'US-5483466-A', 'US-6125177-A', 'US-5249164-A', 'US-4775974-A', 'US-5483595-A', 'US-6415329-B1', 'US-5245429-A', 'US-5452357-A', 'US-5659350-A', 'US-4720873-A', 'US-5634190-A', 'US-5341425-A', 'US-5404583-A', 'US-5420866-A', 'US-5506904-A', 'US-5526404-A', 'US-6219713-B1', 'US-5367571-A', 'US-5163046-A', 'US-5223923-A', 'US-5131010-A', 'US-7028088-B1', 'US-5319712-A', 'US-6154776-A', 'US-5594782-A', 'US-5101478-A', 'US-4829569-A', 'US-5293250-A', 'US-4663743-A', 'US-5568554-A', 'US-5675742-A', 'US-6105064-A', 'US-5347304-A', 'US-6285658-B1', 'US-5319705-A', 'US-5019910-A', 'US-4793813-A', 'US-5301358-A', 'US-4538073-A', 'US-6160797-A', 'US-5337044-A', 'US-4940963-A', 'US-5532914-A', 'US-6438101-B1', 'US-6502131-B1', 'US-4768228-A', 'US-5058138-A', 'US-5412660-A', 'US-5652795-A', 'US-5387994-A', 'US-5309351-A', 'US-4777657-A', 'US-6411616-B1', 'US-4018993-A', 'US-4736422-A', 'US-5400401-A', 'US-5319707-A', 'US-4933936-A', 'US-6078564-A', 'US-4599647-A', 'US-4918653-A', 'US-5627528-A', 'US-6473793-B1', 'US-4686698-A', 'US-6330226-B1', 'US-6046980-A', 'US-5335276-A', 'US-6137777-A', 'US-5394561-A', 'US-6987741-B2', 'US-6085241-A', 'US-5359593-A', 'US-5193151-A', 'US-4009346-A']","[-0.023864824, -0.1522817, 0.051000066, -0.06346293, -0.028031832, -0.040777553, -0.1780153, 0.0711401, 0.063899495, -0.035836343, 0.16838117, 0.08908222, -0.123238705, 0.013557548, 0.13319625, 0.011529489, 0.13651317, 0.17301172, -0.21601036, 0.13557047, 0.14076898, -0.0044551096, -0.06257948, 0.08620068, -0.1655933, -0.009828634, 0.29628435, 0.05851816, -0.08184622, -0.10468786, -0.20281549, -0.18095417, -0.12601498, 0.04845083, -0.1379154, -0.048435748, 0.10659874, -0.054806657, -0.2016419, 0.17268652, -0.06596188, 0.04673893, -0.12720053, 0.051551405, 0.081618756, -0.0048237825, 0.18899997, 0.093129866, -0.20070398, -0.020488942, -0.22841051, 0.10064916, 0.11911387, -0.020276362, 0.10881965, 0.06851621, 0.11782044, -0.15836683, -0.25146645, 0.008433839, 0.050384443, 0.19618355, -0.0268974, 0.14631225]",True

By storing the algorithm and seed at both the host computer and remote agent terminal, the remote terminal can transmit all pertinent wagering information by only transmitting the actual count of plays sold, thereby reducing the amount of data exchanged by several orders of magnitude. The host computer can then reconstruct the wagers and compare them to winning number combinations. Liability information for each terminal is transmitted back to the agent together with new seed numbers, so the agent terminal may begin selling plays for a new pool while also verifying accurate data exchange. The reduced data exchange makes available novel methods of data transfer, such as satellite packet transmission and cellular service.","['463/16.', '463/17.', '463/22.', '463/42.', '463/41.', '463/25.', '463/40.']","['G07F17/32', 'G07C15/006', 'A63F3/081', 'G07F17/3288', 'G06Q50/34']","['G07C15/00', 'A63F1/00', 'G06F13/14', 'H04L9/12', 'A63F3/08', 'G07F17/32', 'G06F1/02', 'G06F15/16', 'A63F5/04', 'G06Q50/34']","['US-5276312-A', 'US-5871398-A', 'US-4713787-A', 'US-4982337-A', 'US-5954582-A', 'US-4398708-A', 'US-6024640-A', 'US-5119295-A', 'US-4937853-A', 'US-5415416-A', 'US-5417424-A', 'US-4842278-A']",",",True

A radio occultation system includes a transmitter system, a receiver system, and a post-processing system. The receiver system receives the radio signal that is transmitted by the transmitter system through the earth&#39;s atmosphere, where it is occulted, and down converts the received radio occultation signal to generate a down converted signal based on a phase model that uses a refractivity climatology. The receiver system then low pass filters the down converted signal and samples the in-phase and quadrature components of the down converted and low pass filtered signal. The post-processing system receives the in-phase and quadrature components of the down converted and low pass filtered signal, determines the mean residual frequency, and performs additional down conversion of the sampled signal to eliminate aliasing. The post-processing system then re-samples the down converted signal at a higher sampling rate and calculates the accumulated phase and amplitude from the re-sampled signal.","['455/189.1', '455/427.', '455/12.1']","['G01S19/14', 'G01W1/08', 'G01W1/02', 'G01S19/29']",['G01S1/00'],"['US-5675081-A', 'US-2001012318-A1', 'US-6134282-A', 'US-6028887-A', 'US-2002155809-A1', 'US-5579347-A', 'US-6263028-B1']",",",True

One application provides a user-manipulated large-scale dynamic display of systems testing in a real world environment for real time visualization by test personnel. The Global Visualization Process (GVP) system is an integrated software solution for high-performance visualization. GVP software and process is capable of displaying extremely high resolution terrain models and imagery in real time over the entire surface of the planet, as well as a large number of moving entities and their associated graphical models. The system can display imagery at 2 cm/pixel, and infinitely detailed terrain in real time over the whole surface of a planet. All displayed data is referenced to the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84) ellipsoid for true round-earth effects, and can be rendered in correct asymmetric stereo. These features, combined with a network application progamming interface (API), make GVP suitable for flight simulation out-the-window displays, command and control scenarios, and mission review or rehearsal.","['345/428.', '345/419.']","['G06T2210/36', 'G06T19/003', 'G06T17/05']","['G09G5/00', 'G06T17/00', 'G06T15/00', 'G06T17/40']","['US-7010398-B2', 'US-6256043-B1', 'US-7096428-B2', 'US-6229546-B1', 'US-5495576-A', 'US-2001055016-A1']","[0.17715813, -0.2659096, -0.08199302, -0.06454574, 0.010289763, -0.051896628, 0.12759845, -0.081077255, 0.14416537, -0.1248671, -0.07002897, 0.2687396, 0.09502501, -0.008127406, -0.060408458, 0.17791583, 0.09241318, -0.010273839, -0.016632926, 0.19762711, 0.10652115, 0.20737039, -0.17018862, 0.0422137, 0.03427981, -0.07939056, 0.15796062, 0.16058841, 0.18739615, -0.011040462, 0.1128884, 0.015613841, -0.24217518, 0.034198854, -0.21409652, 0.023059083, 0.033122204, -0.19249777, -0.0052144695, 0.03466845, -0.28412646, -0.20743974, 0.03345613, 0.012547117, -0.14194192, -0.08271515, 0.058703534, -0.0013990975, -0.02860569, -0.048918262, -0.12753136, -0.14097139, 0.011871184, -0.0009408716, 0.019529289, 0.033285204, 0.029722689, 0.21012385, -0.09543114, -0.053403098, -0.020236544, 0.1378862, -0.21217762, 0.022082873]",True

Via a communications system and apparatus that is positioned a safe, stand-off distance away from the entrance to a facility, a person entering a facility exits his vehicle or walks up to a machine housing which is equipped with cameras and sensor equipment. A close up view of the persons&#39; identification as well a picture of the person himself is captured and readied for real-time transmission to security personnel well away from the entrants location at the machine. Via wireless transmitter and receiver equipment, and computer hardware and software arrangements incorporated into the system, the entrant and his identification card can be viewed and verified, from a safe standoff distance by on-site, as well as off-site security screening personnel. The utilization of wireless networks and internet communications networks, along with the machines&#39; physical features and use, creates multiple opportunities to detect suspicious behavior by entrants to facility well before they reach an unsafe distance to the entrance. While in operation, and with the person a safe distance away from the entrance, the system further equipped with sensors to detect metal, chemical and biological substances can also send special alerts to the detection of harmful substances, well before the entrant reaches the entrance to the facility or security checkpoint. By design, the system and apparatus creates a new and effective means of deterring terrorists who may be trying to effect a terrorist infiltration by disguising themselves as officials or vendors. Additionally, the system is designed to be laid out so as to prompt a direct separation of a would-be suicide or truck bomber from his vehicle. This can greatly deter his desire to effect an attack at that location, as the chances for nullification and or the detection of suspicious activity by security officers operating the system, well before he reaches his location are greatly in odds against him.","['340/5.2', '340/539.22', '348/156.', '340/937.', '348/143.']","['G07C9/00087', 'H04N7/18']","['G08B1/08', 'H04Q7/00', 'H04N7/18']","['US-3997723-A', 'US-5635981-A', 'US-5550359-A', 'US-2004088584-A1', 'US-2003206100-A1', 'US-6917902-B2', 'US-4581634-A', 'US-6952163-B2', 'US-2006010199-A1', 'US-2004199785-A1', 'US-4821118-A', 'US-6658091-B1', 'US-2006028556-A1']","[0.07816111, -0.17125376, -0.08710779, 0.048096605, -0.1131153, 0.018701604, 0.036897354, 0.020812823, 0.15782818, -0.09462281, -0.01620596, 0.19771506, -0.046330355, 0.0024718707, -0.108670264, 0.1421975, 0.08202157, 0.16469531, -0.073014446, 0.23302226, 0.24691333, 0.22949305, -0.10671877, 0.030320326, 0.16566889, -0.0987409, 0.035109404, 0.36356536, 0.15189238, -0.05648955, 0.097336136, 0.014925803, 0.08201161, -0.12011446, 0.019819481, 0.023875352, -0.01247791, -0.16961695, 0.049493924, 0.08340838, -0.050804053, -0.048865404, -0.15918197, -0.01593006, 0.09004659, 0.044842564, -0.09343037, -0.20729823, -0.05864647, 0.024718622, -0.100341745, 0.07547873, -0.08427512, 0.039989315, 0.11513933, 0.15071927, 0.06440949, 0.06515503, -0.06335096, 0.10358012, -0.14384569, 0.37073442, -0.03626841, 0.08014321]",True

Customers preselect from a list of available music in advance using an interactive screen selector, and pay only for music that they choose to playback for their enjoyment. An antipiracy “ID tag” is woven into the recorded music so that any illegal copies therefrom may be traced to the purchase transaction. Music is transmitted on a fixed schedule or through an active scheduling process that monitors music requests from all or a subset of satellite receivers and adjust scheduling according to demand for various CD&#39;s. Receivers store selections that are likely to be preferred by a specific customer. In those instances where weather conditions, motion of atmospheric layers or dish obstructions result in data loss, the system downloads the next transmission of the requested CD and uses both transmissions to produce a “good copy”. In conjunction with the blanket transmission of more popular music, an automated CD manufacturing facility may be provided to manufacture CD&#39;s that are not frequently requested and distribute them by ground transportation.","['709/229.', '709/219.', '705/58.', 'G9B/27.01', '705/51.', '348/E07.063']","['H04H2201/50', 'H04H60/06', 'H04N21/8106', 'H04N21/8113', 'H04N21/262', 'H04H60/17', 'H04H60/27', 'H04H60/63', 'G11B2220/2529', 'H04H60/18', 'H04H60/21', 'H04H60/22', 'G11B27/034', 'H04H20/08', 'G06Q30/06', 'H04H20/40', 'H04H60/33', 'H04N21/8355', 'G06Q20/1235', 'H04N7/165', 'H04H60/98', 'H04N21/63345', 'H04H60/11', 'G11B2220/41', 'G11B2220/2562', 'H04H60/23', 'H04N21/472', 'G07F17/0014', 'H04H20/74', 'H04N21/6143', 'H04H20/16', 'H04N21/44204', 'H04H20/31', 'G11B2220/2545', 'H04H60/65', 'G11B27/031', 'H04N21/2543']","['G06Q20/12', 'H04N7/16', 'G07F17/16', 'G11B27/034', 'G06Q30/06', 'H04H60/17', 'H04H60/27', 'G06F17/00', 'H04H60/65', 'G11B27/031', 'H04H60/21']","['US-5121430-B1', 'US-4761641-A', 'US-4908713-A', 'US-4734858-B1', 'EP-0097511-A2', 'US-5508815-A', 'US-5420647-A', 'US-5566315-A', 'US-5319735-A', 'US-5640453-A', 'US-5235587-A', 'US-5483278-A', 'US-5592626-A', 'US-5627895-A', 'US-5473584-A', 'US-4654482-A', 'US-4812843-A', 'US-5133079-A', 'US-4155042-A', 'US-4595950-A', 'US-5233423-A', 'US-4862268-A', 'US-4797913-A', 'US-3983317-A', 'US-4575750-A', 'US-4789863-A', 'US-5557541-A', 'US-4559480-A', 'US-5107107-A', 'US-3376465-A', 'US-3848193-A', 'US-5532920-A', 'US-4368485-A', 'US-5121430-C2', 'US-6247130-B1', 'US-5260778-A', 'US-5638113-A', 'US-5274762-A', 'US-5257017-A', 'US-5572442-A', 'US-6044047-A', 'US-4809325-A', 'US-5465291-A', 'US-5628050-A', 'US-5592551-A', 'US-5969283-A', 'US-5051822-A', 'US-5469020-A', 'US-5568272-A', 'US-5495283-A', 'US-5959945-A', 'US-5592511-A', 'US-5283731-A', 'US-5630067-A', 'JP-H10290441-A', 'US-5543856-A', 'US-5214793-A', 'US-5311423-A', 'US-5644859-A', 'US-3993955-A', 'US-5420923-A', 'US-4829569-A', 'US-5373330-A', 'US-5619247-A', 'US-4794465-A', 'US-5073925-A', 'US-5486819-A', 'US-5530751-A', 'US-5612741-A', 'US-5512935-A', 'US-5610653-A', 'US-5123046-A', 'US-5497186-A', 'US-3941926-A', 'US-5469206-A', 'US-5121430-A', 'US-5559549-A', 'US-5600839-A', 'US-4949187-A', 'US-5621840-A', 'US-5251193-A', 'US-5355302-A', 'US-5046090-A', 'US-4332022-A', 'US-5483535-A', 'US-5365282-A', 'US-4847825-A', 'US-5565909-A', 'US-4716410-A', 'US-4476488-A', 'US-4734779-A', 'US-5191573-A', 'US-5438355-A', 'US-5440334-A', 'US-5428606-A', 'US-4734858-A', 'US-5621863-A', 'US-4536791-A', 'US-5414756-A', 'US-5497479-A', 'US-5513260-A', 'US-5646603-A', 'US-5418713-A', 'US-3373517-A', 'US-5297204-A', 'US-5182669-A', 'US-5550863-A', 'US-4094010-A']",",",True

An initialization testing program of the present invention is mounted on a personal computer platform that forces in the rover a loss of signal tracking, thus simulating losses in signal reception caused by obstructions of the satellite signals. A complete initialization is forced to occur. The test program uninitializes the RTK solution by causing a loss of integer ambiguities resolution by forcing a loss of lock on one or more satellites. The test program then monitors the subsequent initialization process, e.g., the time needed to search for phase ambiguity candidates, discovering the prevalent satellite geometry, determination of whether the correct ambiguity candidate was found, finding the ratio of the second best to best solution variances of the ambiguity candidates in the list throughout the candidate propagation process or similar statistical test, computing the RMS error of the solution at the time that initialization was declared and after initialization, and calculating the baseline vector between the rover and base at the time of initialization and after initialization. All such statistical parameters are logged and used in post and real-time analyses of the initialization algorithm.","['342/357.31', '701/469.', '701/477.']","['G01C15/00', 'G01S19/44', 'G01S19/09', 'G01S19/04']","['G01S5/14', 'G01C15/00', 'G01S19/48']","['US-4641254-A', 'US-4310884-A']",",",True

Improper propagation delay due to distance variation between the satellites is detected at the reference station as a failure to detect the second or third unique word during a predetermined time period. Oscillator drift is corrected by changing the frequency and/or phase of the oscillator in one of the satellites through telemetry control circuitry at a control facility which may be the reference station. Improper propagation delay is corrected by adding or subtracting delay in the satellite to satellite communications path by the use of variable delay pads aboard one of the satellites which are remotely controlled by telemetry signals from the control facility.","['370/325.', '370/324.', '455/13.1']",['H04B7/2045'],['H04B7/204'],"['US-3757334-A', 'US-3789142-A']",",",True

The invention uses a Satellite Positioning System (SATPS), such as GPS or GLONASS, to determine the SATPS location of a first reference SATPS station, whose location is known with high accuracy, and of a second mobile SATPS station. The second mobile SATPS station uses two SATPS signal antennas, spaced apart a known distance but arbitrarily oriented. SATPS antennas at the first and second SATPS stations each receive SATPS signals from a plurality of SATPS satellites that can be used to determine the location of each antenna. The location of each SATPS antenna may be determined using differential corrections for the location of the first SATPS station antenna. The locations of the two SATPS signal antennas at the second SATPS station define a baseline for purposes of determination angular orientation. This angular orientation information, plus information provided by angle and range readouts for the designated object from a rangefinder positioned adjacent to the second SATPS station, allows determination of the location of the designated object without requiring use of magnetic field-dependent instruments such as magnetic compasses that may be inaccurate when used adjacent to metal structures or sources of intense electromagnetic fields. Another approach uses triangulation of the designated object location from two or more spaced apart known locations of the second SATPS station and does not require angular orientation information. Information on the location of the designated object can be processed at the second SATPS station, at the first SATPS station, or at any other place that has SATPS signal processing equipment.","['342/357.52', '342/357.36', '342/352.']","['G01S19/07', 'G01C15/00']","['G01S19/53', 'G01S19/14', 'G01S5/14', 'G01C15/00', 'G01S5/00']","['US-5233357-A', 'US-5252982-A', 'US-4949089-A', 'US-5194871-A', 'US-5185610-A']",",",True

A GPS receiver for receiving signals from GPS satellites is attached to the person. A processor processes the signals received at a plurality of points from sub-sets of GPS satellites to determine the Earth Centered Earth Fixed (ECEF) fix in the x, y, and z planes relative to the center of the earth of each point. The processor detects when the signals are received from a different sub-set of satellites and corrects for the resulting fix error. The processor calculates the relative distance of the segment between the ECEF fixes of each pair of sequentially adjacent points, and adds together the distances of the segments to determine the distance of the path traveled by the person, which is defined by the points. Errors associated with determining position relative to navigational references such as latitude and longitude are not incurred because relative ECEF fixes are used to determine the distance rather than latitude and longitude fixes. Also, &#34;Selective Availability&#34; error, which is an error introduced into GPS signals by the U.S. military that limits the accuracy of GPS fixes relative to navigational references, does not degrade the accuracy of the distance calculations because the relative distance between the points is used to determine the distance traveled, rather than the distance of the points from navigational references. The processor calculates the elapsed time between selective points, and determines the average speed or pace of the person between selective points and current speed in minutes/mile. A storage device stores data structures representing the ECEF fixes of selective points, and data structures representing relative times that GPS signals are received at selective points.

In addition, the satellite (106) may also periodically re-compare the reception timing of the OFDM uplink signals (108, 110) with the satellite timing reference to generate new timing corrections, if necessary, for the CPEs (102, 104).","['370/203.', '370/319.', '370/343.']","['H04L5/023', 'H04B7/208']","['H04L5/02', 'H04B7/208']","['US-4901310-A', 'US-5771223-A', 'US-5787123-A', 'US-5956318-A', 'US-5909436-A', 'US-5867478-A', 'US-4719619-A', 'US-5444697-A', 'US-5923666-A', 'US-5914933-A', 'US-4879713-A', 'US-5471464-A', 'US-5506836-A']",",",True

The ITR system combines data from a ground-based reference unit at a fixed location with data from a mobile unit on the aircraft. Single-frequency Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers in the units provide a sequence of measurement data for each navigation satellite in view. Additional data is collected from the aircraft&#39;s radio altimeter when the aircraft passes over the threshold of the runway. The aircraft&#39;s trajectory is determined at the end of the time interval under analysis, after all measurements have been received. ITR employs a unique procedure to establish the exact distance from the aircraft to each of several GNSS satellites using both pseudo-range and carrier signal information. The aircraft&#39;s position is determined from these distances using a least-squares adjustment procedure. The ITR distance-determination procedure is based on the fact that the aircraft-to-satellite distance is proportional to the total phase of the carrier signal. The total carrier phase consists of an accumulated phase and in initial integer ambiguity. While the accumulated phase is measured directly by the GNSS receiver, the integer ambiguity is resolved by using an iterative search for the correct integer set within a search volume defined by the a-priori uncertainty in aircraft&#39;s position.

The GPS user receiver computes a LEO user-reference carrier phase difference and a GPS user-reference carrier phase difference for the LEO satellite signal and a GPS satellite signal, respectively, received simultaneously at the GPS user receiver and the GPS reference receiver. Carrier phase double differences are computed from a difference between the GPS user-reference carrier phases from two GPS satellites and either the LEO user-reference carrier phases from two LEO satellites or the GPS user-reference carrier phase from one GPS satellite and the LEO user-reference carrier phase from one LEO satellite. The location vector is computed from a difference between the double differences for two satellite geometries. The GPS reference receiver communicates the reference carrier phase data to the GPS user receiver through the LEO satellite. An ionospheric delay model is determined by tracking the LEO satellite signal as the LEO satellite traverses the sky. An optional calibrator corrects for measurement delay in determining the carrier phases in the GPS user receiver and the GPS reference receiver.","['342/357.44', '342/457.', '342/357.48', '701/489.', '701/470.', '342/357.71', '342/357.49']","['H04B7/18552', 'G01S19/44', 'G01S19/04']","['H04B7/185', 'G01S19/12', 'G01S5/14', 'G01S19/07', 'G01S19/11', 'G01S19/31', 'G01S1/00']","['US-5563607-A', 'US-5519620-A', 'US-5654717-A', 'US-5758261-A', 'US-5594740-A', 'US-4445118-A']","[-0.011644573, 0.051112875, -0.14774989, 0.03821376, 0.051250875, 0.022625946, -0.04648011, -0.08983392, 0.15384817, -0.08994087, -0.1300508, 0.1759184, 0.15540378, -0.11805504, 0.06323102, 0.025931802, 0.017813852, -0.09173968, -0.26945576, 0.11547786, 0.14943402, -0.15595748, 0.034404553, 0.13744728, -0.046860225, -0.015901597, 0.11581738, 0.21880096, 0.21596526, -0.029401941, 0.144813, -0.16830586, -0.1557993, -0.0887245, 0.045542914, 0.07631843, 0.13811816, -0.19332114, -0.052595384, 0.13113847, -0.28157833, -0.19335255, 0.08298039, 0.051411908, 0.06713306, -0.09035066, 0.0062445723, 0.18267035, -0.04367245, 0.043683056, -0.061219323, -0.08832239, -0.11279209, 0.11959907, 0.054730844, 0.06451014, 0.20269382, 0.15060294, -0.14330213, 0.11856072, 0.013854217, 0.17776313, -0.20789908, 0.06795475]",True

SWMS has three subsystems: The first subsystem includes a network of earth satellites called Satellite Engines (SEs) used to reflect solar energy and/or transform solar energy into other forms of energy beams discharged at specified locations. The media at these locations and the media through which the energy beams pass absorb these energies and change them into heat. The second subsystem includes a large network of Remote Sensing Devices (RSDs). These sensors are used to measure local media compositions, dynamic parameters and thermodynamic properties. Sensor measurements are fed back to the third subsystem, which includes a network of Ground Control Stations (GCSs). GCSs provide energy beam guidance by estimating each beam&#39;s characteristics and its aim point trajectory as functions of time. Integration of these three subsystems establishes a sensor feedback energy beam guidance and control loop. SWMS&#39;s weather modification applications include alteration of precipitation, reclaiming of wasteland, reducing damage by bad weather, and improving environment. Its non-weather related applications include supplying concentrated energy to electricity generating stations (solar, wind and hydro), high latitude greenhouse farms, and solar powered airplanes.","['244/172.7', '244/158.1', '73/170.27']","['Y02T50/62', 'B64G1/1085', 'B64D27/24', 'B64G2001/1042', 'B64G1/10', 'B64G1/428', 'A01G15/00']","['B64D27/24', 'A01G15/00', 'B64G1/10', 'B64G1/42']","['US-5675081-A', 'US-5631414-A', 'US-3564253-A', 'US-5114101-A', 'US-4371135-A', 'US-4305555-A', 'US-5646343-A']","[0.13908915, -0.05957544, -0.013264909, -0.08906391, -0.035545576, 0.082971774, 0.009002074, -0.04574464, 0.3488764, -0.21528652, -0.007292127, 0.17627485, 0.25285172, -0.074795984, 0.049881127, 0.22688209, 0.06941411, 0.11208803, -0.16456272, 0.19780791, 0.09920076, 0.08773863, -0.14557219, -0.03867109, 0.100766264, -0.10533465, 0.14022736, 0.08781578, 0.12488151, -0.07726629, 0.02408443, -0.10871857, -0.07845261, 0.12046254, -0.19106893, 0.0330538, 0.06778031, -0.20330909, -0.04180543, 0.032407254, -0.27680308, 0.07793826, 0.065587945, -0.043461427, -0.14695758, 0.047748666, -0.004330952, 0.09566634, -0.118682995, 0.080332264, -0.032738145, -0.18373667, -0.08895854, 0.033322766, 0.13904625, -0.13572603, 0.09191626, 0.082729995, -0.08521799, 0.022258751, 0.07196688, 0.19816183, -0.17513323, 0.01855295]",True

This method can be applied even if ground control points are not set. Without propagation of an error throughout the image and also without needing an excessively large amount of calculations, the method makes it possible to correct ground-relief-associated distortions caused by the relief of a ground surface. According to the method, a plurality of control planes of different elevations are set relative to a control plane of a zero elevation of a reference rotating ellipsoidal earth model. A corrected image is divided into blocks by lattices of equal intervals. With respect to each of these blocks, distortion model formulas in the form of bilinear functions are determined for the respective control planes. Concerning each pixel position in the corrected image, two pixel positions in an observed image, which correspond to the elevation value of the pixel position in the block, are calculated by using distortion model formulas for two control planes which directly sandwich the value of elevation above and below the value in the corresponding block. By the value of elevation, the two pixel positions are linearly interpolated to determine the desired pixel position in the observed image.","['382/100.', '382/300.', '382/295.']","['G06T5/006', 'G06T3/0081']","['G06T11/60', 'G06T5/00', 'G06T1/00', 'G06T3/00', 'G09B29/00']","['US-6694064-B1', 'US-6393163-B1', 'US-6084989-A', 'US-4708472-A', 'US-6011505-A']","[0.03206407, -0.08832354, -0.16723153, -0.14188708, -0.03768507, -0.00588925, 0.027809383, -0.11883659, 0.15527724, -0.03422143, -0.052068528, 0.24749132, 0.16428891, 0.00857011, -0.09469095, 0.14610478, 0.0562806, 0.037304357, -0.09389494, 0.09662434, 0.12192103, -0.069144264, -0.22692326, 0.12403988, -0.17659937, -0.12495889, 0.25361517, -0.0023578156, 0.16890551, 0.04930291, 0.13512854, -0.16312413, -0.36458063, 0.02630496, 0.040624302, -0.016135234, 0.016030354, -0.16523449, 0.11176607, 0.056716826, -0.25189906, -0.24762516, 0.039213255, -0.056609362, -0.025307387, -0.1606515, 0.06817262, 0.066109456, 0.08934846, -0.06678207, -0.08334687, 0.013802291, 0.005896115, 0.076484285, 0.06393628, 0.0837421, 0.104341105, 0.05381713, -0.12862588, -0.045066528, -0.06263591, 0.12785871, -0.14839578, 0.17005208]",True

Each filter has a main waveguide and several short-circuited half wavelength stubs in serial connection to the main waveguide. The joint between the two halves bisects the waveguide broadwall and is, therefore, of no electrical significance. The simplicity of the design lends itself to fabrication as part of a bigger integral assembly consisting of duplexers and other feed components. After manufacture, no further tuning is necessary.","['333/212.', '333/135.', '333/208.', '333/248.']","['H01P1/2138', 'H01P1/209']","['H01P1/213', 'H01P1/209']","['US-3727152-A', 'GB-723919-A', 'US-3497835-A', 'US-4200847-A', 'US-2588226-A', 'US-3204205-A', 'GB-950094-A', 'GB-987460-A', 'DE-3208029-A1', 'US-3157847-A', 'GB-1007967-A', 'US-3579153-A', 'US-2984798-A', 'US-2421033-A']","[-0.066114336, -0.0009899073, -0.16670677, -0.032716334, -0.036513675, 0.024859462, 0.0008233399, -0.11789237, 0.09898338, -0.22239856, 0.21609625, 0.05145494, -0.025394497, -0.087118186, 0.068968244, -0.09416419, 0.17707494, 0.043963198, -0.35316283, 0.022125458, -0.12582085, -0.11394974, -0.13302416, 0.040055092, -0.05466001, -0.12429882, 0.078783356, 0.08943285, 0.1022065, -0.07081193, -0.09333158, -0.011437335, -0.01931656, -0.024742043, -0.02480146, -0.080109574, 0.105916835, -0.22014597, 0.12911005, 0.018727202, -0.109919265, 0.1411887, 0.09620113, -0.18821083, 0.2382746, 0.024170881, 0.12905669, 0.10824965, -0.17333546, -0.16715246, -0.10761369, 0.0742244, -0.22198571, 0.049787644, -0.11287132, 0.113152616, 0.123324856, -0.04105498, -0.09877399, -0.12404702, 0.028417783, 0.05418022, -0.30991858, 0.124650836]",True

In response to requests from the PGPS Client, the PGPS Server produces and disseminates an initial seed dataset consisting of current satellite orbit state vectors and orbit propagation model coefficients. This seed dataset enables the PGPS Client to locally predict and propagate satellite orbits to a desired future time. This predictive assistance in turn helps accelerate Time To First Fix (TTFF), optimize position solution calculations and improve the sensitivity of the GPS chip present on, or coupled with, the device. In contrast with other conventional predicted GPS systems that forward large volumes of predicted orbits, synthetic ephemeris or synthetic almanac data, this method optimally reduces data transfer requirements to the client, and enables the client to locally synthesize its own predicted assistance data as needed. This method also supports seamless notification of real-time satellite integrity events and seamless integration of predicted assistance data with industry standard real-time assistance data.","['342/357.42', '342/357.66']","['G01C21/20', 'H04W4/02', 'G01S19/258', 'G01S19/05', 'G01S19/27']","['H04B7/185', 'G01S19/25']","['US-6542820-B2', 'US-6829535-B2', 'US-6651000-B2', 'US-7158080-B2', 'US-6133872-A', 'US-6704651-B2', 'US-7043363-B2', 'US-6560534-B2', 'US-7009555-B2', 'US-7091904-B2', 'US-2007273581-A1', 'US-6703972-B2']",",",True

So long as the measured orbit conforms to a desired orbit to within a preselected tolerance, periodic corrections of equal magnitude are made to the satellite&#39;s velocity, based on a prediction of the effect of atmospheric drag on the orbit. Measurement of the orbit is made by observation of the time that the satellite passes a reference point in the orbit, such as by crossing the ascending node. If the measured orbit departs from the desired orbit by more than the preselected tolerance, a velocity correction of a magnitude different from the one based on prediction is applied to the satellite. For a decaying orbit, the magnitude of the velocity correction is increased above the correction value based on prediction. For a rising orbit, the magnitude of the velocity correction is decreased below the value based on prediction, and may be reduced to zero, allowing atmospheric drag to bring the measured orbit back within the preselected tolerance range.","['244/164.', '342/354.', '701/531.', '701/78.', '701/4.', '244/171.', '701/13.', '342/352.', '244/167.', '244/169.']","['B64G1/24', 'G05D1/0883', 'B64G1/26', 'B64G1/36']","['B64G1/24', 'G05D1/08', 'B64G1/26', 'B64G1/36']","['US-5050087-A', 'US-4161780-A', 'US-4752884-A', 'US-5184790-A', 'US-5227802-A', 'US-5267167-A', 'US-4730798-A', 'US-3944172-A', 'US-4288051-A', 'US-5222023-A', 'US-4617634-A', 'US-5326054-A', 'US-5163641-A', 'US-4912475-A', 'US-4358076-A', 'US-5132910-A', 'US-4801940-A', 'US-4958788-A', 'US-4776540-A', 'US-4102958-A', 'US-3866025-A', 'US-5109346-A', 'US-4837699-A', 'US-5279483-A', 'US-5528502-A', 'US-4599697-A', 'US-5077561-A', 'US-5149022-A', 'US-4911385-A']","[0.01676655, -0.16962564, -0.1408538, 0.03258708, 0.057242725, -0.00085331907, 0.076489285, 0.045293972, 0.22019905, -0.023240348, -0.19918461, 0.18216455, 0.32571647, -0.061373796, 0.10621562, 0.12787235, 0.061362132, 0.0280559, -0.17449817, 0.15067331, -0.027140988, -0.14933456, -0.1935151, 0.04861031, 0.1587777, -0.16011684, 0.015997665, 0.08610392, 0.15875722, 0.057403006, 0.120415635, -0.21892847, -0.26859266, 0.094744116, -0.08283552, 0.15539022, 0.11874807, -0.20155242, -0.018919544, 0.09383447, -0.09644693, -0.10205329, 0.13492742, -0.057778403, -0.08489264, 0.111542195, -0.03665439, 0.16892152, 0.08028745, 0.007678193, -0.016522376, -0.06889579, 0.015542516, 0.06197781, 0.0979228, -0.07920933, 0.2204719, -0.011968075, 0.0020839935, 0.14432509, 0.024219459, 0.07009253, -0.1454839, 0.12233888]",True

A central hub may enforce global timing by utilizing an individual timing correction loop over the network, and enforce global timing synchronization by sending frequent individual timing correction requests and receiving acknowledgements.","['455/427.', '455/12.1']","['H04L1/22', 'H04B7/18528', 'H04B7/2125', 'H04L5/023', 'H04B7/18578', 'H04B7/18519']","['H04L5/02', 'H04B7/212', 'H04B7/185', 'H04L1/22']",['US-5933454-A'],"[-0.18787318, 0.120416135, -0.053378742, -0.06405694, -0.09491226, -0.1436934, -0.0050477376, -0.11773339, 0.18430421, -0.107551135, -0.03685277, -0.00061797193, -0.1389228, -0.062990054, 0.12394959, 0.06999997, 0.17050894, 0.19779901, -0.20197374, 0.08473342, 0.10513515, -0.12471953, -0.051671617, 0.131427, -0.05134838, -0.092592806, 0.15835588, 0.057849474, 0.057414126, 0.027406892, -0.18958375, -0.14744218, -0.25088766, -0.046129007, -0.15048635, 0.0259105, -0.08001027, -0.22245502, -0.19704251, 0.21256478, -0.1615828, 0.08038323, 0.0032587792, 0.07350643, 0.07744621, -0.08456124, 0.1360636, -0.0042318455, -0.10725801, -0.03069127, -0.23174968, -0.0346131, 0.042800393, 0.046738688, -0.00087196444, 0.06900788, 0.0025755456, 0.06174573, -0.22201858, 0.09898793, 0.059706844, 0.18899204, -0.2138889, 0.15223394]",True

The estimated route is comprised of a plurality of position segments, each position segment having a corresponding mileage and average expected speed. The route of travel may be checked for accuracy by comparing the estimated route mileage to the odometer mileage. If a significant difference is found, a diagnostic procedure is performed which attempts to correct the mismatch by evaluating alternate routes of travel. If the alternative route mileage agrees with the actual odometer miles within a predetermined threshold, the new route and associated mileage is used as the &#34;true&#34; route taken by the vehicle. The diagnostic procedure can also identify position segments where the vehicle appeared to be traveling much slower or faster than the average speed for that position segment. The mileage difference can then be allocated proportionally to each identified suspect position segment to provide an accurate estimate of the miles driven within the predetermined jurisdiction. Once the route of travel has been verified, the mileage traveled by the vehicle can be accurately determined and used for various computations. For example, state fuel-taxes may be accurately calculated from the mileage information.","['701/410.', '701/420.', '342/357.74', '701/468.', '342/357.3', '342/357.33', '342/357.69']","['G01S5/02', 'G08G1/127', 'H04B7/18554', 'G01C21/28', 'G01C22/02', 'G01S1/24']","['H04B7/185', 'G01S5/14', 'G01S5/02', 'G08G1/127', 'G01C21/28', 'G01C22/02', 'G01S1/24']","['US-5017926-A', 'WO-9514909-A1', 'US-5682133-A', 'US-5359528-A', 'US-5541845-A', 'US-5068656-A', 'DE-4402614-A1', 'EP-0825418-A2', 'US-5767804-A', 'US-5787383-A', 'US-5648768-A', 'US-5694322-A', 'US-5751245-A', 'US-5422815-A', 'US-5699255-A', 'WO-9636018-A1']",",",True

Channel estimation is accomplished within a receiver time block with locally generated reference symbol sequences. The parameters of the decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) are computed directly from the channel estimates. The DFE is an optimum finite length realization that includes effects from spectrum control filtering, a space-time block coder (STBC) on multiple transmit antennas, multiple receiver diversity signals, and the fading dispersive channel. The DFE includes a matched filter, forward filter, backward filter, and detector. A symbol combiner within the matched filter produces a P+1 dimensional signal that provides ideal cancellation of P intersymbol interferers in the forward filter. When P is selected to meet an intersymbol interference (ISI) criterion, all desired signal energy is collected and all ISI can be ideally cancelled.

Deinterleaving over multiple receiver time blocks further compensates for channel estimation variations from block to block.

(As to weather reporting, one mechanism is in effect a calibration of simultaneous satellite-based data. As to acoustic receivers, the mechanism is orienting receivers to the wind, to minimize wind-noise pickup.) These functions are based on observing, from a distance below the surface, light intensities of many areas of the irregular water surface.

In one or more embodiments, the client, e.g., a GPS receiver, receives a set of parameters for a satellite from the server via a wireless or wired connection. The set of parameters includes a force parameter, initial condition parameters and time correction coefficients for the satellite. The receiver uses the received parameters in a numerical integration to compute the position of the satellite at a desired time. The set of parameters needed for the integration is small compared to current methods which require sending more data to the client. Thus these parameters require less communication resources to transmit. To further reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, reference parameters may be subtracted from the original parameters before transmission from the server. The receiver is able to reconstruct the original parameters from the received parameters and the identically computed reference parameters. The parameters may be further compressed using data compression techniques.","['701/400.', '342/357.64', '342/357.66']","['G01S19/05', 'G01S19/27', 'G01S19/25']","['G01C21/00', 'G01S19/25']","['US-7839331-B2', 'US-5963167-A', 'US-6437734-B1', 'US-6157621-A', 'US-5490076-A', 'US-2007024496-A1', 'WO-0013971-A2', 'US-6085128-A', 'WO-0116618-A1']",",",True

SWMS has three subsystems: The first subsystem includes a network of earth satellites called Satellite Engines (SEs) used to reflect solar energy and/or transform solar energy into other forms of energy beams discharged at specified locations. The media at these locations and the media through which the energy beams pass absorb these energies and change them into heat. The second subsystem includes a large network of Remote Sensing Devices (RSDs). These sensors are used to measure local media compositions, dynamic parameters and thermodynamic properties. Sensor measurements are fed back to the third subsystem, which includes a network of Ground Control Stations (GCSs). GCSs provide energy beam guidance by estimating each beam&#39;s characteristics and its aim point trajectory as functions of time. Integration of these three subsystems establishes a sensor feedback energy beam guidance and control loop. SWMS&#39;s weather modification applications include alteration of precipitation, reclaiming of wasteland, reducing damage by bad weather, and improving environment.

Time information acquired by a GPS satellite is corrected by ranging information of a discovery function of an OLT so as to be reflected on time information of each ONU. A propagation delay from the L2SW to the OLT is obtained with the use of a delay estimation mechanism, a propagation delay from the OLT to the ONU which is obtained by ranging is added to obtain a propagation delay from the L2SW to the ONU. The obtained propagation delay from the L2SW to the ONU is added to the transmitted time stamp value whereby a time stamp value received at a base station or femtocell side becomes a time into which the propagation delay to the ONU is incorporated, and absolute values of clock timers can be synchronized with each other. The addition process can be realized by rewriting the time stamp value of the packet within the OLT or the ONU.","['398/102.', '398/99.', '398/154.']","['H04J3/0655', 'H04J3/0673', 'H04J3/0644', 'H04J3/0682']","['H04L7/00', 'H04J3/00', 'H04J14/08', 'H04J3/06', 'H04B10/00']","['US-2012008953-A1', 'US-2009067850-A1', 'US-2013004160-A1', 'JP-2010278546-A', 'WO-2011058625-A1', 'US-2011129218-A1', 'US-2011262133-A1']","[-0.13464884, 0.0885779, -0.016810302, -0.06500395, -0.0840734, 0.049101487, 0.08716987, -0.02142006, -0.013852161, -0.09315946, 0.06493561, 0.051068824, 0.10292775, -0.009203702, -0.028419018, 0.031310037, 0.18594429, 0.05177726, -0.32221252, 0.09963337, 0.28144506, -0.115602806, 0.007944621, 0.21903805, -0.16249205, 0.16509692, 0.18382211, 0.18236044, 0.13142091, 0.05487736, -0.18897477, 0.07530155, -0.11402867, -0.052994933, -0.11909276, 0.06116276, -0.15663776, -0.056248408, -0.16703959, 0.20457058, -0.09766259, 0.06417772, -0.03133024, -0.064922206, 0.067983046, 0.036423873, 0.053252447, 0.03136579, -0.042908743, -0.0046683988, -0.28249326, -0.07768355, -0.037274636, -0.0031641086, -0.13422692, -0.04105761, 0.0002588915, -0.1409402, -0.13027261, -0.06832068, 0.084534064, 0.34842905, -0.08804523, 0.05841983]",True

1053,US-4932070-A,19900605,US,22883401,Mechanism for deriving accurate frequency reference for satellite communications burst demodulator,"Accurate tuning of a satellite system&#39;s burst demodulator to a signal which is subject to frequency offset in the course of its transmission over the satellite link is achieved without the use of high precision oscillators at remote sites, or the transmission of a dedicated pilot tone. Instead, a dedicated high precision clock is used for the purpose of establishing both the outlink carrier and the return channel carrier. The modulation of the data on the outlink carrier is also derived from the precision clock source. At each remote station, the outlink channel is monitored to recover the high precision clock. This recovered clock is then used as a reference for generating the return channel carrier. The burst demodulator equipment at the master station monitors both the outlink channel continuous carrier and burst mode transmissions from the remote stations. Each of the continuous and burst mode carriers, having been transmitted through the satellite, will undergo the same frequency offset or modification, so that the frequency difference between the outlink channel carrier and the return link channel carrier will always be constant. The outlink channel carrier, which is available on a continuous basis, is used to derive a local oscillator frequency reference for establishing the burst demodulator&#39;s local oscillator reference.","['370/316.', '455/10.', '455/13.2', '455/504.']",['H04L27/2271'],"['H04B7/212', 'H04L27/227']","['US-4703479-A', 'US-4748622-A', 'US-4509200-A', 'US-4554672-A']","[0.030911166, 0.08424201, -0.06379308, -0.15313458, -0.016031696, -0.004068837, 0.04735746, -0.14840245, 0.083474614, -0.004804541, -0.053173427, 0.058875874, -0.008893632, -0.11229302, 0.14137165, -0.021543369, 0.13509144, 0.0025103674, -0.22067057, 0.09989816, 0.0014345777, 0.059290353, -0.03426707, 0.16573313, 0.10619253, -0.02348099, -0.02109724, 0.07586449, 0.042940162, -0.28305438, -0.18243682, -0.21806893, -0.21228991, -0.08703946, -0.04880285, 0.011379744, -0.049673326, -0.14026211, -0.21673654, 0.18436548, -0.12810299, 0.11506442, 0.055271022, -0.07521124, 0.27144077, 0.07187602, 0.088331304, 0.019787, -0.12354792, 0.09661693, -0.20686267, 0.0010898651, 0.002401788, -0.041142203, -0.010757012, 0.06481141, -0.04250519, -0.0077709244, -0.24779582, 0.04144726, 0.08675877, 0.17530778, -0.3037861, 0.22570305]",True

At the moon, the satellite is in the so-called fuzzy boundary or weak stability boundary. A negligibly small maneuver can then bring it back to the Earth on a reverse BCT to the desired Earth inclination. Another maneuver puts it into the new ellipse at the earth. In the case of satellites launched from Vandenberg AFB into LEO in a circular orbit of an altitude of 700 km with an inclination of 34°, approximately 6 km/s is required to change the inclination to 90°. The previous flight time associated with this method was approximately 170 days. A modification of this method also achieves a significant savings and unexpected benefits in energy as measured by Delta-V, where the flight time is also substantially reduced to 88 or even 6 days.","['244/158.5', '701/531.', '701/13.']","['B64G1/007', 'B64G1/242', 'B64G2001/247']","['B64G1/24', 'B64G1/00', 'B64G1/10', 'G05D1/10']","['US-5158249-A', 'US-5199672-A', 'US-3676581-A', 'US-3532298-A', 'US-5506780-A', 'US-5507454-A', 'US-5120008-A', 'US-5421540-A', 'US-6059233-A', 'US-5067672-A', 'US-4288051-A', 'US-T100604-I4', 'US-5433726-A', 'US-5163640-A', 'US-4618112-A', 'US-5568904-A', 'US-5681011-A', 'US-4599697-A', 'US-5595360-A', 'US-5452869-A', 'US-5064152-A']","[0.10278508, -0.2149481, 0.016889289, 0.03750424, 0.042477682, -0.06534716, 0.09639417, -0.059416905, 0.107060835, -0.08426868, -0.16504906, 0.24269667, 0.23793736, -0.18292353, 0.033100486, 0.08782444, 0.036837805, 0.027540065, -0.15585685, 0.21799129, 0.103725344, 0.14752826, -0.2353419, 0.08734096, -0.013174129, -0.12251684, 0.056511343, 0.0712352, 0.26014012, -0.13221663, 0.037970457, -0.14336924, -0.093722075, 0.12888242, -0.16117227, 0.08615122, 0.032668307, -0.24385276, 0.087485835, 0.14546777, -0.117708266, -0.17292984, 0.14665596, -0.13557038, -0.11061312, 0.057546396, -0.03645864, 0.2789573, 0.06575668, -0.05219009, -0.16013114, -0.08652742, 0.088669814, -0.009448787, 0.01292557, -0.024925781, 0.15574564, 0.035469096, 0.03574422, 0.021945486, 0.0832068, -0.031528346, -0.086331114, 0.030750623]",True

To locate more accurately the geographical position of targets detected by the sensors of an orbiting satellite, the pitch, roll, and yaw boresight errors caused by distortions or misalignments in the focal plane of the sensors are compensated for by comparing known position coordinates of an object (such as a star) to the observed position coordinates. The known position coordinates are converted to sensor coordinates by a series of intermediate coordinate conversions, essentially from the celestial frame of reference to an earth-centered frame of reference to a satellite attitude frame of reference to the satellite frame of reference to the sensor frame of reference. The corrections are applied frequently enough to take into account the change of the satellite&#39;s position relative to the sun to compensate for the thermal effects, inter alia, causing the boresight error.

The system stores the location of the golf cup in computer memory and determines the location of a global positioning satellite receiver positioned near the golf ball. The system calculates the distance between the golf cup location and the receiver location. Preferably, the receiver includes a display of the golf hole being played, with the location of the receiver on the hole, the golf cup on the green, and the distance to the golf cup being displayed. In a preferred form the player can designate a mark on the display and find out the distance from the receiver to the mark or the distance from the mark to the golf pin. The position of the receiver is error corrected, with the error correction preferably calculated using a reference global positioning satellite receiver positioned at a known location. The known location is compared to the apparent position to calculate the error correction. The error correction is periodically transmitted and the remote receiver calculates the distance from the remote receiver to the golf cup for the hole being played using the transmitted error correction. Using an error corrected position enables distance calculation accuracy to within several meters even using global positioning satellite system &#34;c&#34; code with selective availability enabled.

This seed dataset enables the PGPS Client to locally predict and propagate satellite orbits to a desired future time. This predictive assistance in turn helps accelerate Time To First Fix (TTFF), optimize position solution calculations and improve the sensitivity of the GPS chip present on, or coupled with, the device. In contrast with other conventional predicted GPS systems that forward large volumes of predicted orbits, synthetic ephemeris or synthetic almanac data, this method optimally reduces data transfer requirements to the client, and enables the client to locally synthesize its own predicted assistance data as needed.

These phase coherent measurements are combined to form a precise differential carrier ranging (DCR) solution that is used to provide three-dimensional position guidance of the aircraft throughout a precision approach and landing procedure.","['342/410.', '342/357.53', '342/357.48', '342/357.24']","['G01S19/11', 'G01S19/07']","['G01S19/44', 'G01S19/46', 'G01S19/07', 'G01C21/00', 'G01S19/11', 'B64D45/04']","['US-4866450-A', 'US-5068656-A', 'US-4359733-A', 'US-4819174-A', 'US-4774672-A', 'US-4804937-A', 'US-4894655-A', 'US-5014206-A', 'US-4701760-A']","[-0.060477775, 0.07968211, -0.08591667, -0.048281383, 0.053548064, 0.013981702, 0.05532963, -0.1442363, 0.0125364, -0.064697325, -0.12760533, 0.16284493, 0.105195835, -0.14650267, 0.06041336, -0.010724665, 0.0767925, -0.028846908, -0.24742891, 0.20615157, 0.039823636, -0.07080201, 0.03068892, 0.08968046, -0.10576962, 0.023858009, 0.06432935, 0.30559307, 0.19308965, -0.15188535, 0.056640074, -0.35484856, -0.14109722, -0.070084766, 0.09164188, 0.08079346, -0.0406582, -0.19225648, -0.12674327, 0.17405535, -0.18749705, -0.16705644, -0.0228454, 0.04639573, 0.10000794, 0.045304943, 0.06216858, 0.15212284, -0.12811938, 0.08507721, -0.070509605, -0.010039908, -0.0775163, 0.079614446, -0.056475166, -0.06715705, 0.08945746, 0.0634733, -0.11709307, 0.14656863, 0.013879754, 0.23497276, -0.19834277, 0.15767509]",True

A sales agent&#39;s terminal uses the algorithm and seed to produce random number combinations for each play from a pool, assigning the number combinations sequentially and printing them, together with a sequential serial number, onto lottery tickets. By storing the algorithm and seed at both the host computer and remote agent terminal, the remote terminal can transmit all pertinent wagering information by only transmitting the actual count of plays sold, thereby reducing the amount of data exchanged by several orders of magnitude. The host computer can then reconstruct the wagers and compare them to winning number combinations. Liability information for each terminal is transmitted back to the agent together with new seed numbers, so the agent terminal may begin selling plays for a new pool while also verifying accurate data exchange. The reduced data exchange makes available novel methods of data transfer, such as satellite packet transmission and cellular service.","['463/25.', '708/250.', '463/17.', '463/22.']","['G07F17/32', 'G07C15/006', 'A63F3/081', 'G07F17/3288', 'G06Q50/34']","['A63F3/08', 'A63F1/00', 'G06F13/14', 'H04L9/12', 'G07F17/32', 'G07C15/00', 'G06F1/02', 'G06F15/16', 'A63F5/04', 'G06Q50/34']","['US-5569082-A', 'US-4922522-A', 'US-5330185-A', 'US-5354069-A', 'US-5340119-A', 'US-4713787-A', 'US-5119295-A', 'US-4937853-A', 'US-5239165-A', 'US-5223698-A', 'US-4882473-A', 'US-5356144-A', 'US-4323770-A', 'US-4494197-A', 'US-4982337-A', 'US-4897531-A', 'US-5592212-A', 'US-5083272-A', 'US-5415416-A', 'US-5417424-A', 'US-4996705-A', 'US-5317135-A', 'US-3786234-A', 'US-4764666-A', 'US-4959783-A', 'US-5276312-A', 'US-4339798-A', 'US-5157602-A', 'US-5588913-A', 'US-4842278-A']",",",True

The catalyzed decomposing foam significantly lowers the weight and structure of all space hardware. This packaging system is especially beneficial where several or even hundreds of satellites are required for a constellation system, thereby significantly benefiting all technologies applied in space, ranging from the telecommunication industry to DOD applications.

After injection of the satellite by a launch vehicle into the transfer orbit at its perigee, with an initial attitude approximating the predetermined final attitude for the apogee motor firing, the right ascension β of the satellite is modified to confer on it an intermediate attitude such that the earth is in the field of view of the terrestrial sensors for a position of the satellite in the transfer orbit offset at least 10° from the apogee. The declination α of the rotation axis of the satellite is measured and then adjusted to the value required for the apogee motor firing. Maintaining this declination constant, the right ascension is adjusted on the basis of the solar sensor measurements so as to bring the satellite into its final attitude, and the apogee motor firing is then commanded.","['244/164.', '244/169.', '701/13.']","['B64G1/363', 'B64G1/26', 'B64G1/281', 'B64G1/24', 'B64G1/365', 'G05D1/0883']","['G06F19/00', 'B64G1/28', 'G05D1/08', 'B64G1/26', 'B64G1/36', 'B64G1/24', 'G01C21/24']","['FR-2373823-A1', 'US-4837699-A', 'EP-0209429-A1', 'US-4776540-A']","[0.07613692, -0.071840875, 0.049910612, -0.07137018, 0.06517388, 0.07810902, -0.023423424, -0.008842407, 0.07946631, -0.06084863, -0.07611769, 0.19765268, 0.17742883, -0.07009201, 0.19910592, 0.040492672, 0.12962294, 0.09183679, -0.15654175, 0.095576696, 0.026026743, -0.15111098, -0.1900825, 0.10003855, 0.11315528, -0.12661658, 0.10168129, 0.11645616, 0.24174632, -0.0028191751, 0.16189171, -0.17003049, -0.19685248, 0.13180053, -0.115072034, 0.24786241, 0.11072085, -0.15007381, 0.11263403, 0.1004602, -0.024900986, -0.19020878, 0.23558637, 0.15982692, -0.067890234, 0.083942, 0.059007384, 0.10684396, 0.16787058, -0.15477574, 0.042293303, -0.123672046, 0.032265723, 0.13398413, -0.032280497, -0.21674247, 0.06991028, 0.03992751, -0.032150336, 0.17684062, -0.011664288, 0.026659189, -0.13595387, 0.12643993]",True

The GPS user receiver computes a LEO user-reference carrier phase difference and a GPS user-reference carrier phase difference for the LEO satellite signal and a GPS satellite signal, respectively, received simultaneously at the GPS user receiver and the GPS reference receiver. Carrier phase double differences are computed from a difference between the GPS user-reference carrier phases from two GPS satellites and either the LEO user-reference carrier phases from two LEO satellites or the GPS user-reference carrier phase from one GPS satellite and the LEO user-reference carrier phase from one LEO satellite. The location vector is computed from a difference between the double differences for two satellite geometries. The GPS reference receiver communicates the reference carrier phase data to the GPS user receiver through the LEO satellite. An ionospheric delay model is determined by tracking the LEO satellite signal as the LEO satellite traverses the sky. An optional calibrator corrects for measurement delay in determining the carrier phases in the GPS user receiver and the GPS reference receiver.","['342/357.44', '342/457.', '342/357.48', '701/489.', '701/470.', '342/357.71', '342/357.49']","['H04B7/18552', 'G01S19/44', 'G01S19/04']","['H04B7/185', 'G01S19/12', 'G01S5/14', 'G01S19/07', 'G01S19/11', 'G01S19/31', 'G01S1/00']","['US-5563607-A', 'US-5519620-A', 'US-5654717-A', 'US-5758261-A', 'US-5594740-A', 'US-4445118-A']",",",True

Customers preselect from a list of available music in advance using an interactive screen selector, and pay only for music that they choose to playback for their enjoyment. An antipiracy “ID tag” is woven into the recorded music so that any illegal copies therefrom may be traced to the purchase transaction. Music is transmitted on a fixed schedule or through an active scheduling process that monitors music requests from all or a subset of satellite receivers and adjust scheduling according to demand for various CD&#39;s. Receivers store selections that are likely to be preferred by a specific customer. In those instances where weather conditions, motion of atmospheric layers or dish obstructions result in data loss, the system downloads the next transmission of the requested CD and uses both transmissions to produce a “good copy”. In conjunction with the blanket  20  transmission of more popular music, an automated CD manufacturing facility may be provided to manufacture CD&#39;s that are not frequently requested and distribute them by ground transportation.","['705/52.', '705/59.', '705/26.1', '705/51.', '705/26.61', '705/26.8', '705/27.1']","['H04H60/06', 'H04N21/8106', 'H04N21/262', 'H04H60/17', 'H04H60/27',

The GPS receiver apparatus includes a GPS signal receiver for receiving a GPS satellite signal modulated with data bits and a radio signal receiver for receiving a radio signal having a standard time and/or a standard frequency. The radio signal receiver provides standard time information to the GPS signal receiver. The GPS signal receiver uses the standard time information to resolve a GPS time for a time of arrival of a data bit. The GPS signal receiver includes a propagation delay calibrator for correcting the standard time for the travel time due to the path length for the radio signal. The radio signal receiver uses a reference clock signal provided by the GPS signal receiver for determining a frequency error between a frequency of the reference clock signal and the standard frequency. The GPS signal receiver uses the frequency error for pre-tuning to the carrier frequency of the GPS satellite signal.,['342/357.62'],"['G01S19/235', 'G04R20/04']",['G01S1/00'],"['US-5477228-A', 'US-5523761-A', 'US-5499032-A']",",",True

An Integrity Monitor (IM) informs mobile stations, their users, or networks of measurement quality and it warns them of failing and failed GPS satellites by isolating them from the effects of these failures. Whenever an unhealthy satellite is detected, its corresponding assistance data will be excluded for delivery or for position determination. In other words, there are two specific aspects to the Integrity Monitor (IM). For DGPS users, it predicts the reliability or quality of the DGPS corrections. For all users, it isolats the mobile position calculation from the effects of GPS satellite failures. The UDRE parameter, nominally output by a reference DGPS receiver, is used to communicate the DGPS quality information, and DGPS corrections are simply excluded for failed satellites. For autonomous GPS users, a special integrity message is required and defined to communicate the satellite failure status information.","['342/357.44', '342/357.45']","['G01S5/0045', 'G01S5/009', 'G01S19/235', 'G01S19/07', 'G01S19/20', 'G01S19/08', 'G01S19/256', 'G01S19/258', 'G01S19/05']","['H04Q7/38', 'G01S5/14', 'G01S19/07', 'G01S19/20', 'H04Q7/34', 'G01C21/00', 'G01S19/08', 'G01S1/00', 'G01S19/27', 'G01S5/00']","['US-5436632-A', 'US-5175557-A', 'US-5148452-A', 'US-5786773-A', 'US-5884220-A', 'DE-19537923-A1', 'US-5786789-A', 'GB-2264837-A']",",",True

Potential platforms for the probe beam and detector subsystems include satellites and airborne vehicles, and mapping of large geographical regions is accomplished by tomographic reconstruction of recorded columnar absorption data. The use of bistatic geometries reduces power requirements on the probe beam, as compared to standard backscatter DIAL, and allows detection with platforms at large stand-off ranges, subject to atmospheric conditions. Operation in spectral regions including UV, visible and IR is feasible, provided that there are no overlapping absorption lines when many substances are present. Use of multiple frequency sources and multi-spectral detectors will reduce identification ambiguities. A variant bistatic configuration, using corner cube or gimbaled reflectors will also allow similar stand-off and area coverage to a system with a remote detector, but with much higher source beams and/or lower sensitivities due to return path losses. In excellent atmospheric conditions, detector sensitivities to parts-per-billion (ppb) are possible.","['250/573.', '356/73.', '356/436.', '250/574.', '356/437.', '356/432.', '356/438.']",['G01J3/42'],['G01J3/42'],"['US-4386854-A', 'US-3532428-A', 'US-5428447-A', 'US-4483614-A', 'US-3768908-A']",",",True

In one embodiment, a momentum bias satellite is in an orbit slightly inclined from the geostationary orbit. The desired angular momentum vector attitude is chosen based on the orbit, the desired payload attitude, and the gimbal capabilities, and executed using thrusters. This reorientation limits the required gimbal travel. Based on this information, time-varying payload offsets in yaw, pitch and roll are computed from the nominal attitude produced by nulling earth sensor errors in roll and pitch, and using momentum bias and yaw estimation to control yaw. These offsets are implemented by a 3-axis gimbal between the momentum bias and the payload. Other sensors, actuators, or orbits could be used, including beacon sensors, star sensors, magnetic torquing, solar torquing, electronic steering, and other gimbal arrangements.",['244/165.'],"['B64G1/285', 'B64G1/365', 'G01S3/7867', 'B64G1/36']","['B64G1/28', 'G01S3/786', 'B64G1/36']","['US-5042752-A', 'US-4911385-A', 'US-4084772-A', 'US-4776540-A']",",",True

N bits are permuted by deriving a keyed permutation of representative indices. When N is factorable into p and q, the set of indices are divided into two portions. The portions undergo iterative processing called “rounds,” and in each round, a first half-round function operates on the first portion to form a first half-round value; the first half-round value and the second portion are added together by a modulo-p adder to form a first output value; a second half-round function operates on the second portion to form a second half-round value; and the second half-round value and the first portion are added together by a modulo-q adder to form a second output value. In this manner, outputs of the rounds are reordered. 
     If N is prime and not less than 13, then N is separated into composite values s and t, and two sets are formed with s and t elements, respectively. Each set is then permuted using the method for when N is not prime. At the end of each round, the two blocks are combined using a mixing operation.","['380/37.', '380/28.', '713/189.']","['H04L9/3073', 'H04L9/0625', 'H04L2209/80', 'H04L9/0643', 'H04L9/3242', 'H04L9/3033', 'H04L2209/24']","['H04L9/32', 'H04L9/28', 'H04K1/00', 'G09C1/00']","['US-5511123-A', 'US-4969190-A', 'US-4754482-A', 'US-6185679-B1', 'US-4850019-A', 'WO-0051286-A1', 'US-6038317-A', 'US-5077793-A']",",",False

The earth-horizon sensor operates in the infrared range and comprises, in the focal plane of an input lens, a chopper disk, which is periodically reciprocated with a determined chopper frequency (f) and which has a diameter corresponding to the image of the earth, and a detector (1) receiving the periodically interrupted radiation of opposite earth rims. The output signal of the detector is demodulated synchronously with the chopper frequency (f) and corrected with a correction signal corresponding to different temperatures of opposite earth rims (earth anomaly). In order to be able to use the earth-horizon sensor not only as a ZERO-seeking sensor, but also as an angle-measuring sensor the amplified detector output signal is additionally demodulated synchronously with the second harmonic wave of the chopper frequency (2f) thereby producing a presence signal (U p ). This presence signal, or a reference signal produced from the presence signal and the amount of the corrected off-course signal (|U DO  |), respectively, are used in order to draw the characteristic line of the earth-horizon sensor into the desired characteristic line of the earth-horizon sensor, also during a &#34;off-pointing&#34;, by controlling the amplification factor for the detector output signal, which is applicable for the instance when the line of sight of the earth-horizon sensor, which line of sight is fixed with respect to the satellite, is aligned with the earth central point.","['250/351.', '250/338.1', '250/347.', '250/342.']","['G01S3/787', 'G01S3/7868', 'G01S3/781']","['G01S3/786', 'G01S3/787', 'B64G1/36', 'G01S3/781']","['US-3714432-A', 'US-3551681-A', 'US-3486024-A', 'US-3920994-A', 'US-3638021-A']","[0.0062412396, 0.060667686, -0.2218233, -0.05723304, 0.0892429, 0.055467945, -0.009466647, -0.0031805672, 0.1467871, 0.00042443204, 0.0012520121, 0.12441405, 0.20885023, -0.1492052, 0.17950597, 0.042964544, 0.22494479, 0.0153455855, -0.110213235, 0.07205319, 0.013022817, -0.23661777, -0.10240907, 0.2380267, 0.091914065, -0.02841623, 0.27579534, 0.090846494, 0.036312472, 0.000491712, 0.073444396, -0.29770985, -0.17838632, 0.055917278, 0.069644146, -0.028299764, -0.0021531302, -0.04716305, 0.002548802, 0.113974, -0.046841674, -0.0724945, 0.05714944, 0.046204217, 0.03569597, 0.009969326, -0.16812344, -0.04100577, -0.015272908, -0.103201285, -0.060875792, -0.22699824, -0.09629389, 0.20036332, 0.076541156, -0.07529126, 0.16270638, 0.08407279, -0.16536254, 0.012619673, -0.10537028, 0.24997874, -0.20121263, 0.11448455]",True

The combination provides sufficient signal power to the aircraft, enables interference from other satellites to be rejected and maintains the power spectral density of the satellite&#39;s video transmission within FCC requirements. The polarization of the receive array is aligned with that of the incoming beam from the relay satellite by means of an error signal feed back path to control the steering weights of the array. Because the phased arrays are conformal, it is necessary to modify the phase shift settings produced by the antenna steering mechanism executed by the degree of departure of the conformal geometry of the array from a planar configuration.

In the standby mode, the operation of the RF section, correlator section, and microprocessor section is inhibited while the reference oscillator and time continue to operate. In order to increase acquisition speed upon entering the normal mode, the microprocessor section provides the correlator section with an initial frequency adjustment to correct for drift in the reference frequency during the standby mode. The microprocessor section provides the initial frequency adjustment based upon a learned frequency correction that is based upon the frequency adjustment that results in acquisition of the GPS satellite signal after alternating one or more times between the standby mode and the normal mode. Alternately, the initial frequency adjustment is calculated from a stored frequency/temperature relationship and a temperature for the reference oscillator measured by a temperature sensor.","['342/352.', '342/357.65', '342/357.74']","['G01S19/34', 'G01S19/235']",['G01S1/00'],"['US-4968981-A', 'US-5323164-A', 'US-5203030-A', 'US-5296861-A', 'US-5036329-A', 'US-4423419-A', 'US-4677441-A', 'US-5222245-A', 'US-5059969-A']",",",True

The system (100) includes at least one user terminal (124, 126) and a base station (112), or gateway (120, 122) for communicating with the user terminal (124, 126) through a satellite (116, 118) with predetermined known orbital positions or patterns. A communication signal (130, 132, 146, 148) is precorrected for known Doppler effects, such as between a gateway and a transferring satellite (146, 148), when used, and transmitted to a user terminal. The user terminal (124, 126) determines the signal frequency relative to a reference oscillator (240), and treats any detected difference as resulting completely from Doppler. The frequency difference is either transferred as data in reverse link transmissions (130, 132, 140, 142), or used as a pre-correction factor for such transmissions. The frequency of the reverse link user terminal signals is measured at the gateway (120, 122), again compensating for known Doppler effects, to provide a nominal error measurement. Measured frequency error or offsets are then divided in half to arrive at a Doppler shift error, or divided in half and scaled to the appropriate frequency to arrive at a user terminal oscillator error. The detected error can be transmitted to the user terminal (124, 126) for use in correcting the oscillator output frequency, or for adjusting the timing of, or time tracking for, the user terminal (124, 126).

A GPS search mode architecture is used to detect SV signals and identify potential cross-correlations. The GPS search modes have different coherent integration lengths and different degrees of sensitivity. After detection, measurements are logged into a database for further processing. Several cross-correlation tests are described. For example, a “Mainlobe” cross-correlation test is described that identifies the most significant cross-correlations that occur when the Doppler difference between the interfering SV signal and the target SV signal is nonzero and a multiple of 1 kHz. Appropriate C/No and Doppler thresholds, or masks, are selected and used to identify the mainlobe cross-correlations. A wide Doppler mask is used to account for the effects on cross-correlations caused by BPSK data bit modulation. A “variable C/No” cross-correlation test is described that accounts for the effects on cross-correlations when the Doppler difference between an interfering SV and a target SV is high. A “strong” cross-correlation test is used to detect combined cross-correlations generated when two or more signals fall very close to each other in both code phase and Doppler frequency. A “wide Doppler” test is used when multiple SVs concurrently transmit signals that are relatively close in Doppler frequency, but not sufficiently close as to produce a cross-correlation peak of very strong energy. A pre-emptive cross-correlation test is described that performs cross-correlation testing early in the SV signal search process.",['342/357.25'],"['G01S19/246', 'G01S19/21', 'G01S19/25']","['G01S19/26', 'G01S1/00', 'G01S19/21']","['US-6236354-B1', 'US-6282231-B1', 'US-6646596-B2', 'US-2002026282-A1']","[-0.1927689, 0.1569406, -0.14522457, -0.11092813, 0.02371222, -0.01939029, -0.041418537, -0.15384148, 0.06532336, -0.049420785, -0.08506958, 0.023575272, -0.017919254, -0.09052986, 0.002225607, -0.052928243, 0.080030255, -0.050518803, -0.20783594, 0.12840363, 0.18930534, 0.059674025, 0.011451912, 0.04178106, -0.06206506, 0.055898283, 0.1450943, 0.27749088, 0.2482728, -0.091677554, -0.005162728, -0.2445003, -0.023538517, -0.09149614, 0.05587038, 0.029351568, -0.026798619, -0.12444017, -0.14222378, 0.1751787, -0.115796514, -0.22548512, 0.015276181, 0.084967926, 0.07429056, -0.012464554, 0.11721977, 0.11167801, 0.06678284, 0.07362712, -0.036759846, 0.037042513, -0.0797155, -0.044910926, -0.020104866, 0.07022352, 0.2495289, 0.06570834, -0.045440823, 0.2112535, 0.113444366, 0.33954635, -0.19325474, 0.1384105]",True

Analog sensors of this type have low accuracy because of transfer function non-linearity, degradation due to environmental aging, or radiation effects and others. A second periodic sensor is directed at the reference body to provide periodic positional updates. These updates are used as references to which the instantaneous output of a continuous sensor are compared so that error associated with the output of the continuous sensor can be eliminated to the accuracy of the calibration. The first continuous sensor preferably utilizes a first and second double triangle detector arranged to form first and second rectangles each having a slot aperture mounted thereon for projecting a line image normal to each rectangle. The first and second double triangle detectors are arranged orthogonally with respect to each other. An algorithm is used to accurately locate the position of the slit shadows on the first and second detectors on the continuous sensor, and thus provide a continuous position for the reference body such as the sun.

Phase double differences are formed, using the reference and roving receivers and any two satellites drawn from four or more satellites, using phase information obtained from either or both of the two carrier signal frequencies. Phase correction information, in the form of estimates of integer wavelength ambiguities, is then obtained from two sets of ambiguity estimates computed with the roving receiver antenna in each of two specified positions, with the reference receiver antenna lying between and being collinear with the two roving receiver-antenna positions. If the distance between the reference receiver antenna position and the two roving receiver antenna positions is sufficiently small, a set of estimates at only one of the roving receiver positions may suffice. If an azimuth angle measuring device is incorporated in the apparatus, a set of estimates at only one roving receiver position may again suffice. The method produces a set of simultaneous equations that can be solved for the coordinates of a roving receiver located at an arbitrary position.

A hardware circuit is incorporated with that crystal to mirror that same characteristic. A temperature sensor is used to control a compensation applied. The combination outputs a fairly flat temperature response, e.g., near zero delta-frequency change over the operating temperature range. But this flat response has an unknown offset from the true frequency. A next step finds a precision timing reference, such as when the receiver locks onto and tracks GPS satellites. The receiver then knows time precisely and a navigation software can compute the offset accurately. A value is stored for that offset in memory.

The ITR system combines data from a ground-based reference unit at a fixed location with data from a mobile unit on the aircraft. Single-frequency Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers in the units provide a sequence of measurement data for each navigation satellite in view. Additional data is collected from the aircraft&#39;s radio altimeter when the aircraft passes over the threshold of the runway. The aircraft&#39;s trajectory is determined at the end of the time interval under analysis, after all measurements have been received. ITR employs a unique procedure to establish the exact distance from the aircraft to each of several GNSS satellites using both pseudo-range and carrier signal information. The aircraft&#39;s position is determined from these distances using a least-squares adjustment procedure. The ITR distance-determination procedure is based on the fact that the aircraft-to-satellite distance is proportional to the total phase of the carrier signal. The total carrier phase consists of an accumulated phase and in initial integer ambiguity. While the accumulated phase is measured directly by the GNSS receiver, the integer ambiguity is resolved by using an iterative search for the correct integer set within a search volume defined by the a-priori uncertainty in aircraft&#39;s position. The ITR system uses the aircraft&#39;s radio altimeter to constrain the search volume.",['342/357.48'],"['G01S13/882', 'G01S1/026', 'G01S19/44', 'G01S19/15']","['G01S19/11', 'G01S1/00', 'G01S5/14', 'G01S1/02']","['US-5412389-A', 'US-3836970-A', 'US-5440491-A', 'US-5009245-A', 'US-5422813-A', 'US-5072227-A', 'US-5126748-A', 'US-5307289-A', 'US-5438337-A', 'US-4965586-A', 'US-5194871-A', 'US-5361212-A', 'US-5317514-A', 'US-3964066-A', 'US-5365450-A', 'US-5359332-A', 'US-5296861-A', 'US-5177489-A', 'US-5148179-A', 'US-4894655-A', 'US-5017926-A', 'US-4359733-A', 'US-5444450-A', 'US-4839656-A', 'US-5442363-A']","[-0.010276072, 0.08832857, -0.105558306, 0.022032963, 0.038867425, 0.023414025, -0.0126847215, -0.114641495, 0.14794298, 0.006881697, -0.168901, 0.20932132, 0.12341652, -0.12004099, -0.008014699, 0.05252128, -0.0032827319, -0.042159505, -0.37718612, 0.1045289, 0.12561378, -0.113727756, -0.049708385, 0.14240581, 0.035899296, 0.021409929, 0.04038074, 0.22547385, 0.101968765, 0.01023131, 0.09152267, -0.19320087, -0.22123022, -0.08135036, 0.04283537, 0.099545985, 0.035663795, -0.25605378, -0.028950794, 0.15122937, -0.28245023, -0.21523032, -0.03033717, 0.0021331608, 0.035406828, -0.0045326794, 0.011353418, 0.16477174, -0.01905623, 0.08634727, -0.04277763, -0.08053945, -0.09165967, 0.060387067, -0.002083827, 0.0075832596, 0.1970359, 0.1676078, -0.09656902, 0.09007377, 0.042659175, 0.20535472, -0.21279375, 0.07868744]",True

Gravity data are tied to the international gravity datum when the boat docks about every 30 days. The accuracy of these data is about 0.5 milligals and not sufficiently accurate for detailed quantitative interpretation. It is possible to increase the accuracy of shipboard gravity data twofold by using the procedure we have described. A stable boat with precision navigation and water depth soundings is necessary. Two gravity meters are calibrated to read the same values and times. These are placed near the center of the boat with one meter facing forward and one facing backward for plus and minus cross coupling, or simultaneous accelerations in different directions. Integration of the gravity recordings cancels random noise. This innovation increases the accuracy to 0.35 milligals. Shipboard gravity data are tied to a coarser grid of still gravity readings tied to the international gravity datum at land locations. The boat is stopped and still gravity readings are recorded at sea, forming the coarse grid of data. The still readings are recorded in loops combined with continuous base gravity recordings on land for diurnal control. The accuracy of the still gravity values is about 0.15 milligals.

As a result, the optical spot has a radius comparable with the track pitch, and the data written on neighboring tracks appear in the target track signal in the form of inter-track interference (cross-talk). To tackle the cross-talk problem, cross-talk canceling schemes are normally employed. These schemes use three spots, one spot on the main track and two satellite spots on adjacent tracks. The read signal (C) is improved by minimizing the cross-talk between the satellite signals (S + ,S − ) and the read signal (C). However, due to the decreasing inter-track spacing, the decorrelation concept fails since the satellite spots read too much central track information and become strongly correlated with the read signal (C), which causes “leakage” in the decorrelation.

The system comprising a video source and an encoder that produces a transport stream in communication with the video source, an annotation source, a data packet stream generator that produces encoded annotation data packets in communication with the annotation source and the encoder, and a multiplexer system in communication with the encoder and the data packet stream generator. The encoder provides timestamp information to the data packet stream generator and the data packet stream generator synchronizes annotation data from the annotation source with a video signal from the video source in response to the timestamp information. The multiplexer generates a digital broadcast signal that includes an augmented transport stream from the transport stream and the encoded data packets. A receiver displays the annotation information associated with the video signal in response to a viewer request on a frame by frame basis. A viewer can respond interactively to the material, including performing commercial transactions, by using a backchannel that is provided for interactive communication.","['375/240.08', '375/E07.024', '375/E07.008', '707/E17.111', '375/E07.202', '707/E17.013', '375/240.24']","['H04N21/4622', 'G06F17/30873', 'H04N21/435', 'G06F17/30882', 'H04N21/235', 'H04N21/8583', 'H04N21/4725', 'H04N21/858', 'H04N19/93', 'H04N21/234318', 'H04N21/4728', 'H04N1/64', 'H04N21/8543', 'H04N21/854', 'H04N21/812', 'G06F17/30855', 'H04N21/4722', 'H04N21/4782', 'H04N21/8586']","['H04N21/81', 'G06F17/30', 'H04N21/435', 'H04N1/41', 'H04N21/235', 'H04N21/4725', 'H04N21/2343', 'H04N21/858', 'H04N21/4728', 'H04N1/64', 'H04N21/8543', 'H04N21/854', 'H04N21/462', 'H04N21/4722', 'H04N21/4782']","['US-5600775-A', 'US-4803553-A', 'US-6341178-B1', 'US-6006241-A', 'US-5541602-A', 'US-5708845-A', 'US-5754233-A', 'US-5504534-A', 'US-5583561-A', 'US-5603058-A', 'US-5774666-A', 'US-5452372-A', 'US-4532547-A', 'US-4264925-A', 'US-5499050-A', 'US-4507680-A', 'US-4602279-A', 'US-5883670-A', 'US-5632007-A', 'US-5926172-A', 'US-5999970-A', 'US-5101280-A', 'US-4811407-A', 'US-5640601-A', 'US-5452006-A', 'US-5861881-A', 'US-5930797-A', 'US-4748512-A', 'US-5008751-A', 'US-4792849-A', 'US-4743959-A', 'US-5754250-A', 'US-5533021-A', 'US-5907322-A', 'US-5905523-A', 'US-6501853-B1', 'US-5845083-A', 'US-RE34340-E', 'US-5912994-A', 'US-5130792-A', 'US-5912675-A', 'US-5045940-A', 'US-4829372-A', 'US-5978029-A', 'US-5969715-A', 'US-5590262-A', 'US-5838828-A', 'US-5195092-A', 'US-4016361-A', 'US-4264924-A', 'US-5208665-A', 'US-5949410-A', 'US-5630067-A', 'US-5889746-A', 'US-6002455-A', 'US-5835146-A', 'US-5991799-A', 'US-5008745-A', 'US-5918012-A', 'US-5727090-A', 'US-4847698-A', 'US-5786855-A', 'US-5903816-A', 'US-4122477-A', 'US-6006265-A', 'US-5655050-A', 'US-5267333-A', 'US-4941040-A', 'US-5757968-A', 'US-5805204-A', 'US-4847700-A', 'US-5689799-A', 'US-5977989-A', 'US-4903317-A', 'US-5774664-A', 'US-4573072-A', 'US-5715176-A', 'US-5771073-A', 'US-5815634-A', 'US-5883633-A', 'US-5949476-A', 'US-6006256-A', 'US-5124811-A', 'US-6008857-A', 'US-5404173-A', 'US-5883975-A', 'US-5768431-A', 'US-5961603-A', 'US-4847699-A', 'US-5990890-A', 'US-5347322-A', 'US-5969755-A', 'US-5790269-A', 'US-5585858-A', 'US-5946318-A', 'US-6728412-B1', 'US-4959718-A', 'US-5724091-A', 'US-5933532-A', 'US-5371519-A', 'US-5014125-A', 'US-5526024-A', 'US-5977962-A', 'US-5541662-A', 'US-5832121-A', 'US-5644354-A', 'US-5848352-A']",",",False

A next step of the method (d) receives the transponded at least one signal with the ground station; (e) determines a gain of the received at least one signal; (f) compares the determined gain to a gain expected to be received based on a predetermined knowledge of a spatial variation in gain of the satellite antenna; and (g) and determines a difference between the determined gain and the expected gain to derive a correction signal indicative of an attitude error of the satellite. The method further includes the steps of transmitting the correction signal to the satellite; and correcting the attitude of the satellite in accordance with the correction signal. For the case where the correction signal has a value that is a function of the yaw error angle of the satellite, the method further includes the steps of transmitting the correction signal to the satellite; and correcting the attitude of the satellite in accordance with the correction signal by rotating the satellite about the yaw axis so as to reduce a magnitude of the yaw error angle.","['342/354.', '455/12.1', '455/429.', '342/358.', '342/355.']","['B64G1/363', 'B64G1/366', 'B64G1/1007', 'B64G1/365', 'B64G3/00', 'B64G1/24', 'H04B7/2041', 'B64G1/66', 'G05D1/0883']","['H04B7/216', 'H04B7/195', 'G05D1/08', 'B64G1/36', 'B64G1/24', 'B64G3/00', 'B64G1/10', 'H04B7/204', 'B64G1/66']","['US-4901307-A', 'US-5446756-A', 'US-5239671-A', 'EP-0322349-A2', 'US-5010317-A', 'JP-S5949613-A', 'US-5339330-A', 'US-5439190-A', 'US-5070338-A', 'EP-0421698-A2', 'US-4567485-A', 'WO-9013186-A1', 'US-3414214-A', 'US-4599619-A', 'US-5448623-A', 'US-5303286-A', 'WO-9109473-A1', 'US-5621415-A', 'US-RE32905-E', 'US-4630058-A', 'US-4910524-A', 'US-5119225-A', 'US-4910792-A', 'US-5433726-A', 'US-5073900-A', 'US-5081703-A', 'US-5233626-A', 'US-5410728-A', 'US-5216427-A', 'US-RE32905-F1', 'US-5109390-A', 'US-5422647-A', 'US-5258764-A', 'WO-8600863-A1']",",",True

The system (100) includes at least one user terminal (124, 126) and a base station (112), or gateway (120, 122) for communicating with the user terminal (124, 126) through a satellite (116, 118) with predetermined known orbital positions or patterns. A communication signal (130, 132, 146, 148) is precorrected for known Doppler effects, such as between a gateway and a transferring satellite (146, 148), when used, and transmitted to a user terminal. The user terminal (124, 126) determines the signal frequency relative to a reference oscillator (240), and treats any detected difference as resulting completely from Doppler. The frequency difference is either transferred as data in reverse link transmissions (130, 132, 140, 142), or used as a pre-correction factor for such transmissions. The frequency of the reverse link user terminal signals is measured at the gateway (120, 122), again compensating for known Doppler effects, to provide a nominal error measurement. Measured frequency error or offsets are then divided in half to arrive at a Doppler shift error, or divided in half and scaled to the appropriate frequency to arrive at a user terminal oscillator error. The detected error can be transmitted to the user terminal (124, 126) for use in correcting the oscillator output frequency, or for adjusting the timing of, or time tracking for, the user terminal (124, 126). Alternatively, the detected error can be included as data in subsequent signals for use by gateways (120, 122) or base stations (112).","['455/12.1', '455/63.1', '455/67.11', '342/358.', '455/427.', '455/71.']","['H04B7/1855', 'H04B7/01']","['H04B7/208', 'H04B7/01', 'H04B1/16']","['WO-9608882-A1', 'US-5095538-A', 'US-5613193-A', 'US-3864634-A', 'EP-0337269-A2', 'US-5742908-A']",",",True

SWMS has three subsystems: The first subsystem includes a network of earth satellites called Satellite Engines (SEs) used to reflect solar energy and/or transform solar energy into other forms of energy beams discharged at specified locations. The media at these locations and the media through which the energy beams pass absorb these energies and change them into heat. The second subsystem includes a large network of Remote Sensing Devices (RSDs). These sensors are used to measure local media compositions, dynamic parameters and thermodynamic properties. Sensor measurements are fed back to the third subsystem, which includes a network of Ground Control Stations (GCSs). GCSs provide energy beam guidance by estimating each beam&#39;s characteristics and its aim point trajectory as functions of time. Integration of these three subsystems establishes a sensor feedback energy beam guidance and control loop. SWMS&#39;s weather modification applications include alteration of precipitation, reclaiming of wasteland, reducing damage by bad weather, and improving environment. Its non-weather related applications include supplying concentrated energy to electricity generating stations (solar, wind and hydro), high latitude greenhouse farms, and solar powered airplanes.","['244/1.R', '244/53.R', '244/12.1', '244/13.']","['Y02T50/62', 'B64G1/1085', 'B64D27/24', 'B64G2001/1042', 'B64G1/10', 'B64G1/428', 'A01G15/00']","['B64D27/24', 'A01G15/00', 'B64G1/10', 'B64G1/42']","['US-4955562-A', 'US-5503350-A', 'US-4768738-A', 'US-4368415-A', 'US-4415133-A', 'US-4305555-A']","[0.1417721, -0.05247496, -0.017579071, -0.09259551, -0.031875025, 0.0690798, 0.010365686, -0.030189909, 0.35483482, -0.21946143, -0.019073019, 0.16679229, 0.25518298, -0.06651654, 0.050114192, 0.22298698, 0.063877955, 0.099400885, -0.16705959, 0.19939423, 0.09351476, 0.097427964, -0.13817073, -0.030178111, 0.11020282, -0.11250994, 0.15545239, 0.10216887, 0.13308215, -0.071731254, 0.01256129, -0.10955469, -0.081406474, 0.11702777, -0.18359596, 0.041735698, 0.071611516, -0.21503569, -0.049888674, 0.038848445, -0.26627177, 0.081674814, 0.07277903, -0.04340731, -0.14291218, 0.049607094, -0.008106612, 0.08425377, -0.119950026, 0.07324314, -0.028806191, -0.17772721, -0.080424234, 0.03814478, 0.14186919, -0.12464358, 0.092411235, 0.090298645, -0.086199924, 0.022277037, 0.07331126, 0.19720344, -0.17733961, 0.0332573]",True

Channel estimation is accomplished within a receiver time block with locally generated reference symbol sequences. The parameters of the decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) are computed directly from the channel estimates. The DFE is an optimum finite length realization that includes effects from spectrum control filtering, a space-time block coder (STBC) on multiple transmit antennas, multiple receiver diversity signals, and the fading dispersive channel. The DFE includes a matched filter, forward filter, backward filter, and detector. A symbol combiner within the matched filter produces a P+1 dimensional signal that provides ideal cancellation of P intersymbol interferers in the forward filter. When P is selected to meet an intersymbol interference (ISI) criterion, all desired signal energy is collected and all ISI can be ideally cancelled. The DFE processes received signals within the receiver time block to produce information symbol estimates that are subsequently deinterleaved and error-correction decoded to recover the transmitted digital data information. Deinterleaving over multiple receiver time blocks further compensates for channel estimation variations from block to block. Additionally the STBC and DFE are used in a quadruple angle diversity technique requiring only a single antenna at each terminal of a troposcatter link to provide performance approaching that of a nonfading satellite link.",['375/350.'],"['H04L1/0631', 'H04L2025/03426', 'H04L25/0224', 'H04L1/0047', 'H04L25/03057']",['H04B1/10'],"['US-6157811-A', 'US-7336727-B2', 'US-2005047515-A1', 'US-4644562-A', 'US-4112370-A', 'US-5619503-A', 'US-5220320-A', 'US-5736959-A', 'US-5590399-A', 'US-5838742-A', 'US-5987037-A', 'US-5513215-A', 'US-5680419-A', 'US-5596333-A', 'US-5563610-A', 'US-4365338-A', 'US-4328585-A', 'EP-0650271-A2', 'US-2002196842-A1']",",",True

In this manner, the range and Doppler components observed will correspond to [range-sum−direct path] range, and true bistatic target Doppler irrespective of the satellite or receiver induced Doppler shifts.","['342/357.52', '342/453.']","['G01S13/878', 'G01S19/14', 'G01S2013/9058', 'G01S3/02', 'G01S13/586']","['G01S13/58', 'G01S3/02', 'G01S13/90', 'G01S13/87']","['US-5173690-A', 'US-5546087-A', 'US-5252980-A', 'US-5949364-A', 'US-4104629-A', 'US-5187485-A', 'US-5280294-A']",",",True

Complex buffering by system server software allows distributed, parallel, or redundant processing, transmission, and storage for performance, reliability, and robustness. Various parameters of the system can be monitored, and the system can be reconfigured automatically based on the observations. Varied techniques reduce the perceived end-to-end latency and take advantage of software and hardware capabilities that assets connected to the system may possess. One conferencing system allows conference participants to share all or a portion of the display seen on their computer screens. The conferees may be at sites removed from each other, or may view a recorded presentation or archived conference at different times. Conference participants are either “presenters” who can modify the display or “attendees” who cannot modify the display. A pointer icon, which can be labeled to identify the conferee, is displayed on the shared image area. Each conferee can modify the position of his or her own pointer, even when not presenting, so that every participant can see what each conferee is pointing to, should a conferee choose to point to an element of the display. These and other features apply to other data streams shared in the conference or in meetings where there is no shared-image data stream.",['709/204.'],"['H04L12/1822', 'H04L65/605', 'H04L67/10', 'G06F3/1415', 'G06F17/30386', 'H04L12/1836', 'H04L69/329', 'G06F3/04842', 'H04L12/1827', 'H04L65/403', 'G06Q10/10', 'H04L12/1813', 'H04L12/1831', 'H04L67/32']","['H04L29/08', 'G06F15/16', 'H04L12/18']","['US-6313863-B1', 'US-6343313-B1', 'US-5600646-A', 'US-5859979-A', 'US-6314501-B1', 'US-6560707-B2', 'US-5877762-A', 'US-5617539-A', 'US-5649104-A', 'US-5774668-A', 'US-6594699-B1', 'US-5241625-A', 'US-4110560-A', 'US-5550982-A', 'US-6345297-B1', 'US-5530795-A', 'US-5802322-A', 'US-5793980-A', 'US-5689553-A', 'US-5563649-A', 'US-5485212-A', 'US-5983263-A', 'US-6772335-B2', 'US-4414621-A', 'US-5455599-A', 'US-5740371-A', 'US-5737448-A', 'US-5689641-A', 'US-5706290-A', 'US-5790818-A', 'US-5764731-A', 'US-5506832-A', 'US-5822523-A', 'US-5909543-A', 'US-5793365-A']",",",False

The terrestrial repeaters are implemented as OFDM transmitters to minimize the channel impairments caused by multi-path propagation. The OFDM terrestrial repeaters differentially encode the transmitted signal over frequency, as opposed to time, in order to avoid channel phase distortion. The OFDM receiver allocates two unmodulated sub-carriers as pilot bins and thereby provides two sub-carriers as a reference within each OFDM symbol. At the OFDM receiver, the two unmodulated pilot bins contain no phase information and provide a reference for the differential demodulation performed by the OFDM receiver. The OFDM transmitter operates in two modes, namely, a normal mode and a transmitter identifier information (TII) mode. The TII mode contains all of the functions of the normal mode, and also transmits a repeater identification signal with the customer data, using the inactive OFDM sub-carriers (bins). In a normal mode, the OFDM transmitter optionally fills unused (inactive) sub-carriers with zeroes and in a TII mode, the OFDM transmitter uses at least some of the unused (inactive) sub-carriers to transmit the transmitter identifier information (TII). The predefined TII value is mapped onto a set of complex symbols. The TII signal facilitates the receiver test equipment in associating the received signal with the terrestrial repeater(s) that generate the TII signal.",['370/208.'],"['H04H60/54', 'H04L27/2601']","['H04L27/26', 'H04B7/216', 'H04J11/00']","['US-5946293-A', 'EP-0902563-A1', 'US-6134267-A', 'US-5726978-A', 'GB-2261142-A', 'US-5487069-A', 'US-5796785-A', 'US-6072769-A', 'JP-H11215095-A', 'JP-H10200458-A', 'US-5544198-A', 'US-6175550-B1', 'US-6456653-B1']",",",True

This method can be applied even if ground control points are not set. Without propagation of an error throughout the image and also without needing an excessively large amount of calculations, the method makes it possible to correct ground-relief-associated distortions caused by the relief of a ground surface. According to the method, a plurality of control planes of different elevations are set relative to a control plane of a zero elevation of a reference rotating ellipsoidal earth model. A corrected image is divided into blocks by lattices of equal intervals. With respect to each of these blocks, distortion model formulas in the form of bilinear functions are determined for the respective control planes. Concerning each pixel position in the corrected image, two pixel positions in an observed image, which correspond to the elevation value of the pixel position in the block, are calculated by using distortion model formulas for two control planes which directly sandwich the value of elevation above and below the value in the corresponding block. By the value of elevation, the two pixel positions are linearly interpolated to determine the desired pixel position in the observed image.","['382/100.', '382/300.', '382/295.']","['G06T5/006', 'G06T3/0081']","['G06T11/60', 'G06T5/00', 'G06T1/00', 'G06T3/00', 'G09B29/00']","['US-6694064-B1', 'US-6393163-B1', 'US-6084989-A', 'US-4708472-A', 'US-6011505-A']",",",True

The spread spectrum receiver is designed for use in conjunction with a global positioning system (GPS) receiver, and operates to receive broadcast differential GPS correction information. The present frequency synthesis technique contemplates generating a sequence of timing signals within the GPS receiver on the basis of GPS satellite signals received thereby, and providing the timing signals to the signal receiver. Within the signal receiver, the signal cycles of a local oscillator occurring between ones of the timing signals are counted. The frequency of the local oscillator is then determined by dividing the counted cycles of the local oscillator by one of the known time intervals. The determined frequency of output signals produced by the local oscillator is then scaled so as necessary to produce the reference signal of desired frequency. This allows precisely controlled reference frequencies to be obtained irrespective of the existence of frequency instability within the local oscillator. In a preferred implementation, the stable reference signals are employed during acquisition of differential GPS correction signals received by the spread spectrum receiver. In particular, the desired reference frequency is incrementally adjusted during the process of searching for and acquiring the exact frequency of the incident differential GPS correction signals. The spread spectrum receiver is disposed to provide differential GPS correction information extracted from the acquired differential GPS correction signals to the GPS receiver.","['342/357.52', '375/147.', '342/352.', '342/357.44']",['H03L7/00'],"['G01S1/00', 'H03L7/00']","['US-4928106-A', 'US-5420592-A', 'EP-0762654-A1', 'US-5440313-A', 'US-5043736-B1', 'US-5153599-A', 'EP-0564220-A2', 'WO-9428433-A1', 'US-5043736-A', 'US-4112372-A', 'US-5003553-A', 'US-5222099-A']","[-0.043217275, 0.13631144, -0.16124995, -0.09928232, 0.11227174, 0.03515455, 0.06547559, -0.101262346, 0.056198675, -0.021683399, -0.14956929, 0.13359334, 0.120738275, -0.0762128, 0.010563999, -0.11547866, 0.10985774, 0.009260311, -0.1763896, 0.10871255, 0.1295253, -0.06260044, 0.057988312, 0.16468163, -0.00035693106, -0.037453536, 0.074496485, 0.1919277, 0.21889998, -0.121864155, 0.06668233, -0.24251541, -0.20813096, -0.097952306, -0.044499233, 0.054837793, -0.038116235, -0.124328464, -0.13859569, 0.07644566, -0.2921458, -0.109024815, 0.12561926, 0.013444747, 0.14602922, 0.09061196, 0.03528434, 0.20888038, -0.08949498, -0.024805319, -0.03287397, -0.12879016, -0.07601806, -0.05507607, -0.09654218, 0.0077963015, 0.12747133, 0.06331254, -0.09770217, 0.217052, -0.0426004, 0.27424383, -0.24727173, 0.12045914]",True

A sales agent&#39;s terminal uses the algorithm and seed to produce random number combinations for each play from a pool, assigning the number combinations sequentially and printing them, together with a sequential serial number, onto lottery tickets. By storing the algorithm and seed at both the host computer and remote agent terminal, the remote terminal can transmit all pertinent wagering information by only transmitting the actual count of plays sold, thereby reducing the amount of data exchanged by several orders of magnitude. The host computer can then reconstruct the wagers and compare them to winning number combinations. Liability information for each terminal is transmitted back to the agent together with new seed numbers, so the agent terminal may begin selling plays for a new pool while also verifying accurate data exchange. The reduced data exchange makes available novel methods of data transfer, such as satellite packet transmission and cellular service.","['463/25.', '708/250.', '463/17.', '463/22.']","['G07F17/32', 'G07C15/006', 'A63F3/081', 'G07F17/3288', 'G06Q50/34']","['A63F3/08', 'A63F1/00', 'G06F13/14', 'H04L9/12', 'G07F17/32', 'G07C15/00', 'G06F1/02', 'G06F15/16', 'A63F5/04', 'G06Q50/34']","['US-5569082-A', 'US-4922522-A', 'US-5330185-A', 'US-5354069-A', 'US-5340119-A', 'US-4713787-A', 'US-5119295-A', 'US-4937853-A', 'US-5239165-A', 'US-5223698-A', 'US-4882473-A', 'US-5356144-A', 'US-4323770-A', 'US-4494197-A', 'US-4982337-A', 'US-4897531-A', 'US-5592212-A', 'US-5083272-A', 'US-5415416-A', 'US-5417424-A', 'US-4996705-A', 'US-5317135-A', 'US-3786234-A', 'US-4764666-A', 'US-4959783-A', 'US-5276312-A', 'US-4339798-A', 'US-5157602-A', 'US-5588913-A', 'US-4842278-A']","[-0.057454377, -0.06440511, 0.003950447, 0.1222598, -0.0033389546, -0.0070759305, 0.028658623, -0.064186506, 0.16991268, -0.014113338, 0.041701354, 0.18878075, 0.08243548, 0.03317976, 0.01433409, 0.11163176, -0.02384555, 0.20586331, -0.13585323, -0.05400225, 0.3539289, 0.056213096, 0.02209661, 0.02038946, -0.04678119, -0.08976717, 0.16808428, 0.114807785, 0.2434274, -0.18280606, 0.05651218, 0.025681796, 0.18766941, -0.062940925, -0.11759145, -0.10827852, -0.04364398, -0.35593837, -0.025368905, 0.13184327, -0.0782216, 0.027700871, 0.07055494, -0.029350128, 0.08930042, 0.1405245, -0.032337986, -0.030465707, 0.0023354157, 0.059931595, -0.088892214, 0.10214424, 0.12422753, 0.11088094, -0.15423453, -0.03738123, 0.05575088, 0.025696322, -0.2944814, 0.14197657, -0.049629286, 0.15545043, -0.13425706, 0.24453297]",True

In response to requests from the PGPS Client, the PGPS Server produces and disseminates an initial seed dataset consisting of current satellite orbit state vectors and orbit propagation model coefficients. This seed dataset enables the PGPS Client to locally predict and propagate satellite orbits to a desired future time. This predictive assistance in turn helps accelerate Time To First Fix (TTFF), optimize position solution calculations and improve the sensitivity of the GPS chip present on, or coupled with, the device. In contrast with other conventional predicted GPS systems that forward large volumes of predicted orbits, synthetic ephemeris or synthetic almanac data, this method optimally reduces data transfer requirements to the client, and enables the client to locally synthesize its own predicted assistance data as needed. This method also supports seamless notification of real-time satellite integrity events and seamless integration of predicted assistance data with industry standard real-time assistance data.","['342/357.64', '342/357.66']","['G01C21/20', 'H04W4/02', 'G01S19/258', 'G01S19/05', 'G01S19/27']","['G01S19/27', 'G01S19/25']","['US-6542820-B2', 'US-6829535-B2', 'US-6907224-B2', 'US-7612712-B2', 'US-6606346-B2', 'US-2005140545-A1', 'US-6590527-B2', 'US-2006195262-A1', 'US-6219385-B1', 'US-7043363-B2', 'US-2008284646-A1', 'US-2008311870-A1', 'US-2008129593-A1', 'US-6304216-B1', 'US-7091904-B2', 'US-6703972-B2', 'US-6417801-B1', 'US-2008018527-A1', 'JP-2003021672-A', 'US-5909381-A', 'US-6704651-B2', 'US-6915208-B2', 'US-7302225-B2', 'US-6018313-A', 'US-7009555-B2', 'US-5689270-A', 'US-7132980-B2', 'WO-2008055223-A2', 'US-6519466-B2', 'US-7158080-B2', 'US-6133872-A', 'US-2006282216-A1', 'US-5774829-A', 'US-6937187-B2', 'US-6560534-B2', 'US-2008291086-A1', 'US-2007273581-A1', 'US-6651000-B2', 'US-2005231423-A1', 'US-6236365-B1', 'US-2008111738-A1', 'US-6035202-A', 'US-6389291-B1', 'US-2006038719-A1']",",",True

The use of bistatic geometries reduces power requirements on the probe beam, as compared to standard backscatter DIAL, and allows detection with platforms at large stand-off ranges, subject to atmospheric conditions. Operation in spectral regions including UV, visible and IR is feasible, provided that there are no overlapping absorption lines when many substances are present. Use of multiple frequency sources and multi-spectral detectors will reduce identification ambiguities. A variant bistatic configuration, using corner cube or gimbaled reflectors will also allow similar stand-off and area coverage to a system with a remote detector, but with much higher source beams and/or lower sensitivities due to return path losses.

A first set of potential solutions for a first baseline vector and a second set of potential solutions for a second baseline vector determined. Each baseline vector corresponds to any pair of receiver antennas in the array. The baseline vector comprises both the scalar distance between the antennas and the orientation of the line between the antennas in a geospatial coordinate frame. In one embodiment, test results are obtained for at least two tests performed on each potential solution in a set of potential solution. Each potential solution in the sets of potential solutions is evaluated as a candidate for a correct solution for the corresponding baseline vector. The evaluation of each potential solution is based on every test result obtained for that potential solution without disqualifying any one of the potential solutions as a candidate for the correct solution based on any one test result. Comparisons between each potential solution in the first set with each potential solution in the second set determine a degree of geometric consistency between each pair of compared solutions. One of the pairs of compared potential solutions is selected as representative of the attitude of the array if the degree of consistency of that pair satisfies predetermined criteria.",['342/357.38'],"['G01S19/54', 'G01S5/0247']","['G01S5/02', 'G01S19/55']","['US-5534875-A', 'US-5359332-A', 'US-5506588-A', 'US-5296861-A', 'US-5583513-A', 'US-5548293-A']","[-0.10674303, 0.023022177, -0.09482501, -0.052940387, -0.035876043, 0.002897571, -0.010925853, -0.052707363, 0.051712893, 0.025629524, -0.12777926, 0.12821952, 0.121931106, -0.11497118, -0.058159947, 0.015242007, 0.08427052, -0.072664306, -0.22908896, 0.19178262, 0.1408304, -0.11349454, -0.060812227, 0.20120473, -0.030892745, 0.032309894, 0.03669462, 0.23194501, 0.17558356, -0.13389312, 0.14448968, -0.16057172, -0.11662981, -0.07181218, -0.010451414, -0.062774874, 0.04523429, -0.23148893, -0.013633005, 0.091384724, -0.2805389, -0.21459572, 0.11864754, 0.041757148, -0.09818177, -0.11506142, -0.061516337, 0.23856634, 0.007878418, 0.11567794, -0.05106815, -0.041826315, -0.078101285, 0.07953034, 0.009542908, 0.16054842, 0.2217588, 0.11525313, -0.100666836, 0.13911845, -0.025379682, 0.16816646, -0.27502972, 0.097220324]",True

That environment is controlled using a graphically based tool called the LightPiano™, and is then extended through the festival atmosphere in the Club Annex, where licensed merchandise, auctions, and swap meets are located. Online Instant Messaging, Short Message System (SMS) text messaging, Chat, and Fan Clubs generate additional content, which is sent back to the POD. There is extensive use of the Worldwide Web for both local and remote access to the chat, fan clubs, SMS and instant messaging systems, as well as for online access for customers to view scheduling, and purchase ticketing, webcasts and archive access. The Web is also used by the venue owner to manage the entire system for booking, data mining, scheduling, ticketing, webcasting, and facilities management. The Web interface combined with the power of the LightPiano makes this complex interrelated system relatively easy and intuitive to operate. It significantly lowers the cost of operation and makes the system scalable to a large network of POCs and PODs.

In a mobile unit, such as a CDMA device, a correlation pulse is generated when a transmitted code matches a stored reference code. In the absence of multipath effects, correlation pulses are generated in response to the detection of multiple transmissions of the reference code from multiple transmitters. However, multipath effects distort the generated correlation pulses leading to errors in the time of arrival measurements. The present invention calculates the width of the correlation pulses and determines a delay correction factor based on the pulse width. The delay correction factor is added to the measured delay time to provide a more accurate delay time, thus permitting more accurate location measurements based on time of arrival. In alternative embodiments, other signal factors may also be used to apply delay correction factors. The actual location determination may be performed by the mobile unit, or any other positioning determining entity (PDE). The system is also capable of applying correction factors to time of arrival signals received from global positioning system (GPS) satellites.","['455/65.', '455/456.1', '455/504.', '375/E01.032']","['H04B1/1081', 'H04B1/7117', 'H04W84/06', 'G01S19/46', 'H04W24/00', 'G01S19/40', 'G01S19/428', 'G01S5/10', 'G01S5/0273', 'G01S5/0215', 'G01S19/22', 'G01S19/42', 'H04B1/711']","['H04W84/06', 'G01S1/02', 'H04W24/00', 'H04B1/10', 'G01S5/02', 'G01S19/40', 'G01S5/10', 'H04W28/04', 'H04B1/7117', 'G01S19/22', 'G01S1/00', 'G01S19/42', 'H04B1/711', 'G01S19/48']","['US-2001002203-A1', 'US-6198765-B1', 'US-2002183069-A1', 'US-5945948-A']",",",True

Indeed, it is generally asserted that without a priori knowledge (known or measured values) of the tracker position and velocity, line of sight measurements between satellites do not contain adequate information to infer target states. Passive and autonomous navigation of space vehicles without a priori values for the position and velocity of either the target or tracker vehicle is achieved by reconfiguring the extended Kalman filter, or more generally any predictor/correction class filter, to include states for both the target and tracker vehicles. The target and tracker vehicles must both follow trajectories in an inertial frame of reference through the gravitational field of a gravitational body having a known gravitational model. The reconfigured filter simultaneously estimates the position and velocity of both tracking and target space-based vehicles from line-of-sight measurements.","['382/103.', '701/500.']","['B64G1/361', 'B64G1/242', 'G05D1/0883', 'B64G1/36']","['G06K9/00', 'G01C21/16', 'G01C21/24']","['US-5051751-A', 'US-7034742-B2', 'US-7394046-B2']",",",True

A series of coordinate system transformations, corrected by the Kalman filter error estimator, are carried out to provide a command input to an antenna pointing servo system. The servo control system produces a servo error signal representative of a deviation in the actual direction of the antenna pointing mechanism from the command input to the servo loop as defined by the corrected aiming signal. The actual direction in which the servo control system points the antenna is compared with a reference (the actual direction to the satellite). As a result of this comparison, a pointing deviation signal representative of any offset from the intended pointing direction is generated. Because this pointing deviation signal depends upon the output of the servo control mechanism, it inherently contains any error in that output. Such error is removed by subtracting the servo error signal from the pointing deviation signal and applying the resultant difference signal to the Kalman filter error estimator.","['342/359.', '342/422.']","['H01Q1/125', 'G05D3/1454', 'H01Q1/18']","['G05D3/14', 'H01Q1/12', 'H01Q1/18']",['US-4179696-A'],",",True

While the bit sizes of the data blocks have been pre-compressed, the decompressor will decompress the data blocks to reduce the transfer time of the data blocks through the serial interface thereby eliminating a speed bottle of the data transfer rate if the data transfer rate is slower than the data accessing rate of the main memory unit.","['1/1.', '707/999.201', '342/357.77']","['G01S19/37', 'G06F8/65']","['G06F17/30', 'G01S19/29', 'G01S19/46', 'G01S19/21', 'G01S19/11', 'G01S19/05', 'G01S19/37']","['US-6662314-B1', 'US-6170043-B1', 'US-2005138645-A1', 'US-5974454-A', 'US-6113652-A', 'US-2007185648-A1', 'US-2006179301-A1', 'US-7801481-B2']","[-0.04334152, -0.24351606, -0.07273949, -0.08510159, -0.11445995, -0.16212592, 0.08796788, -0.13031529, 0.006206124, -0.02013081, -0.0030311532, 0.20761527, -0.087873735, 0.05391199, -0.15200943, 0.13190393, 0.069789, 0.13797548, -0.17787324, 0.21177779, 0.08872141, 0.018626034, 0.046426605, -0.05695432, 0.16422158, 0.110631995, 0.21530852, 0.14240666, 0.1357259, 0.028868617, 0.067318365, -0.007219978, -0.04961281, -0.04596903, -0.12940624, 0.0320555, 0.13256924, -0.21570098, -0.054659694, -0.054603677, 0.08824477, -0.231047, 0.15833592, 0.21161644, 0.020877343, 0.08215821, 0.05790831, 0.21424754, 0.011568623, 0.11891413, -0.13139004, 0.0723319, 0.15398423, 0.19193882, -0.012537628, -0.016220668, 0.14931548, 0.0018174191, -0.27784282, 0.16575323, -0.10443239, 0.007652292, -0.05391852, 0.072993]",True

Subsequently double-differences are formed by differencing satellite s and the slant residuals of a reference satellite k, leading to zenith residuals calculated by mapping the double-differences to a zenith value. Error values for each reference station are computed by using the zenith residuals and residual dispersive and non-dispersive error values for a potential rover position are estimated by combining residual dispersive and non-dispersive error values of all reference stations.

The present invention independently computes the number of frequency bands necessary to cover the carrier frequency uncertainty and the chip rate uncertainty and uses the largest of the two quantities in the acquisition process. A receiver cycles through pseudonoise code phases until a matched filter output exceeds a threshold. The local code is adjusted based on that code phase and the signal is processed for carrier acquisition, where an FFT estimates the carrier frequency. The code phase and nearest neighbors are used to determine the presence of a false alarm. When a false alarm is absent, the detection is examined for an alias or noise spur. If an alias is absent, the signal search is complete. Otherwise, processing continues to search for a pseudonoise code. The process continues by examining all code phases for each band until a signal is detected.","['375/140.', '342/357.68', '375/E01.01', '375/326.', '342/357.69']","['H04L2027/003', 'H04B1/7077', 'H04L2027/0053', 'H04L27/0014']","['H04B1/707', 'G01S19/30', 'G01S19/29']","['US-5313491-A', 'US-5619524-A', 'US-5974080-A', 'US-2002084933-A1', 'US-6111868-A', 'US-4689626-A', 'US-6069915-A', 'US-5642377-A', 'US-5285472-A', 'US-6490315-B2', 'US-5914943-A', 'US-6366599-B1', 'US-6055264-A', 'US-6512478-B1', 'US-6111911-A', 'US-2006198427-A1', 'US-4538281-A', 'US-6839380-B1', 'US-6363049-B1', 'US-6389058-B1', 'US-5696762-A']",",",False

The contiguous spot beam generating antenna system comprises a reflector system configured in a side-fed Cassegrain (SFOC) configuration, an array of feed horns comprising at least a subset of feed horns for illuminating the reflector system, and a beamforming network, communicatively coupled to the array of feed horns, for controlling an excitation of the subset of the feed horns in the array of feed horns. The method comprises illuminating a side fed offset Cassegrain reflector system with an RF signal emanating from an array of feed horns, and controlling an excitation of the subset of the feed horns. The present invention provides a beamformer network that can produce uniform performance over wide scan angles, is easier to integrate and test, that can change the beam pattern on orbit, and that provides a more complete utilization of space assets without dramatically increasing the cost of manufacturing and operating a satellite. The use of a SFOC configuration or other wide scanning antenna permits the use of a simple beamforming network while maintaining excellent beam beam scanning characteristics.","['343/755.', '343/781.CA', '343/779.']","['H01Q1/288', 'H04B7/18515', 'H01Q3/2658', 'H01Q25/007', 'H01Q19/192']","['H01Q25/00', 'H01Q1/28', 'H01Q3/26', 'H01Q19/19']","['US-5420597-A', 'US-5546097-A', 'US-4628321-A', 'US-5751254-A', 'US-3795003-A', 'US-4516128-A', 'US-6160520-A', 'US-4562441-A', 'US-6061033-A']","[-0.098008856, -0.045460798, -0.082598664, 0.042745557, 0.0035846182, 0.13129465, -0.092588656, -0.20211534, 0.21152288, -0.19076075, -0.12834658, 0.07478583, 0.025212035, 0.019364562, -0.04242035, 0.092644446, 0.11751412, 0.18435803, -0.17640014, 0.15959384, -0.026395837, -0.070916824, -0.04823306, 0.16311722, 0.08187184, -0.19567291, 0.08854258, 0.156642, 0.17478949, -0.07716015, 0.013091757, -0.14631474, -0.14340785, 0.04761622, 0.0008684797, 0.02860491, 0.0848198, -0.27955994, 0.07187365, 0.10866466, -0.057844408, 0.14800566, 0.14853957, -0.071951516, 0.11489009, 0.050288357, -0.07800315, 0.1338248, -0.07771655, -0.08100905, -0.31669164, 0.093464285, -0.20819849, -0.0038834666, -0.04386068, -0.12842415, 0.07681144, -0.08814183, -0.14870644, 0.00981658, -0.09930427, 0.007147276, -0.27575845, -0.022000466]",True

A reference SATPS station is provided with known location coordinates, and pseudoranges PR(t) and pseudorange corrections ΔPR(t) for the reference station are computed as in a conventional differential GPS approach. A matrix equation H(t) ΔW(t)=ΔPR(t) relates the corrections for the spatial location coordinates and clock bias at the mobile station (or at the reference station) to the pseudorange correction values at that station, where H is an M×N matrix (M≦N; N=3 or 4) with known entries. Each of the N rows of the matrix H has M entries and forms a row vector, and these row vectors are linearly independent in an M-dimensional vector space. These row vectors span an N-dimensional vector space. The matrix H is augmented by M-N rows representing independent vectors in an M-dimensional vector space, to produce an augmented M×M matrix H*, for which an inverse H*(t) -1  exists. An augmented matrix equation ΔW*(t;mobile)=H*(t) -1  ΔPR(t) is formed, and N of the entries in the M×1 matrix ΔW*(t) are interpreted as corrections for the spatial location coordinates and/or clock bias for the mobile station. In another embodiment, an M×1 projected vector v is formed from all the uncorrected pseudorange components for the mobile station and a reduced set of these components are transmitted to the reference station. The full vector v is then reconstructed from this reduced set and used to reconstruct the mobile station uncorrected pseudorange values. Corrected mobile station pseudorange values are computed and used to determine the spatial location and clock bias coordinates for the mobile station.","['342/357.29', '701/469.']","['G01S19/41', 'G01S5/0036', 'G01S19/07']","['G01S19/29', 'G01S19/46', 'G01S5/14', 'G01S19/30', 'G01S5/00']","['US-4894662-A', 'US-5148179-A', 'US-4972431-A', 'US-4578678-A']",",",True

With the earth-horizon sensor (1), an off-course signal is formed which is a measurement of the off-course angle of the line of sight of the earth-horizon sensor in relation to the satellite/earth central point connection line and is used for the attitude control of the earth satellite. This off-course signal is corrected in dependence on the earth anomaly. For a fine correcting of the off-course signal, the output signals of the earth horizon sensor which can be assigned to an earth rim with higher temperature, and those which can be assigned to the other oppositely located earth rim with lower temperature, are attenuated or amplified, respectively, in such a way, in dependence on a correction signal taking into account the earth anomaly, that the amplitude changes of the off-course signal caused by the earth anomaly are cancelled.","['250/347.', '250/338.1', '250/351.', '250/342.']","['G01S3/787', 'G01S3/781', 'G01S3/7868']","['G01S3/786', 'G01S3/787', 'B64G1/36', 'G01S3/781']","['US-3714432-A', 'US-3551681-A', 'US-3486024-A', 'US-3920994-A', 'DE-3322750-A1']",",",True

GNSS carrier phase measurements should be compensated for receiver hardware and directionally dependent antenna errors to obtain desired accuracies for high precision GNSS positioning applications. One technique successfully employed in Fixed Reception Pattern Antenna (FRPA) GPS sensors applies a simple directionally dependent set of correction factors to the measurement outputs. For the complex case of a GNSS receiver employing a CRPA and dynamic beam steering, however, the multiplicity of combinations of antenna element outputs makes the FRPA compensation technique impractical. Compensation of carrier phase measurements is a problem not addressed in previous GPS CRPA beam steering sensors.","['342/357.62', '342/372.', '342/377.']","['G01S19/23', 'G01S19/29']","['G01S19/23', 'H01Q3/34']","['US-6642898-B2', 'US-7212921-B2', 'US-6828935-B1', 'US-7440988-B2', 'US-6965816-B2', 'US-7382313-B1', 'US-7181247-B1', 'US-6999027-B1', 'JP-H03234128-A', 'US-6727846-B1', 'US-6469667-B2', 'US-6049307-A', 'US-5410321-A', 'US-6744408-B1', 'US-6847328-B1', 'US-7340283-B1', 'US-7015858-B2', 'US-5694416-A', 'US-7336736-B2', 'US-7525482-B1', 'US-7161528-B2', 'US-7106249-B2', 'US-2009066574-A1', 'US-5955987-A', 'US-6992643-B2', 'US-7304605-B2', 'US-5949372-A', 'US-2005159891-A1', 'US-6266007-B1', 'US-7324064-B2']",",",False

The landmark mask and the upsampled image patch are then processed by one or more matching algorithms to generate line and pixel offset error values indicative of the offset between the predicted position of the landmark and the actual position of the landmark in the image. A match figure of merit is also generated that is indicative of the reliability and accuracy of the computed offset.

The measurable portion of geographically correlated orbit error (GCOE) is removed from the altimeter data sets, thereby allowing the data sets to be combined consistently. The GCOE structure for a reference data set is estimated through crossover difference analysis. The unmeasurable portion of the GCOE is not removed, although the spatial structure of this portion is determined. A reference mean sea level (SL) is corrected for the measurable GCOE and is then used as a reference surface for estimating the GCOE structure for an independent altimeter data set. This is performed by examining crossover differences between the altimeter mean SL and the reference mean SL at the multimission crossover points. The change in sea surface height (SSH) between the input data set and the reference data set is determined. The SSH change allows data sets from different altimeter satellites to be used together.","['702/5.', '342/165.', '342/120.']","['G01S13/882', 'G01S7/4004']","['G01S7/40', 'G01S13/88']",['US-5983162-A'],"[-0.034905717, -0.040414028, -0.08631442, -0.0042110276, 0.117709056, -0.029392134, -0.049259964, -0.15317431, 0.14463526, 0.048320103, -0.05310336, 0.042423178, 0.28549302, -0.0644905, -0.0728325, 0.14445454, -0.019098844, -0.07350524, -0.07342641, 0.05140994, 0.10404116, -0.10736461, -0.067970164, -0.0008251462, -0.0967018, 0.10665705, 0.13883786, 0.03204137, 0.21677342, -0.022489423, 0.17532267, -0.06645717, -0.10160005, 0.0037620233, -0.050934575, 0.13179828, -0.03974893, -0.10924818, 0.0414395, 0.09302606, -0.23468883, -0.27036482, 0.12657732, -0.045929536, -0.028735776, -0.022406695, 0.045443136, 0.14278477, -0.0016733261, 0.120305315, -0.15494463, -0.17444567, -0.08632348, 0.093138136, 0.0106837405, 0.2159116, 0.13712047, 0.11884678, -0.067549504, 0.044971675, 0.008801056, 0.31892908, -0.29579377, 0.24506608]",True

The usual way to change the inclination is perform a maneuver by firing the rocket engines at the periapsis of the ellipse. This then forces the satellite into the desired inclination. There is a substantially more fuel efficient way to change the inclination. This is done by an indirect route by first doing a maneuver to bring the satellite to the moon on a BCT (Ballistic Capture Transfer). At the moon, the satellite is in the so called fuzzy boundary or weak stability boundary. A negligibly small maneuver can then bring it back to the earth on a reverse BCT to the desired earth inclination. Another maneuver puts it into the new ellipse at the earth. In the case of satellites launched from Vandenberg AFB into LEO in a circular orbit of an altitude of 700 km with an inclination of 34°, approximately 6 km/s is required to change the inclination to 90°. The previous flight time associated with this method was approximately 170 days. A modification of this method also achieves a significant savings and unexpected benefits in energy as measured by Delta-V, where the flight time is also substantially reduced to 88 or even 6 days.","['244/158.5', '701/531.', '701/13.']","['B64G1/007', 'B64G1/242', 'B64G2001/247']","['B64G1/10', 'B64G1/24', 'B64G1/00', 'G05D1/10']","['US-5158249-A', 'US-5199672-A', 'US-3676581-A', 'US-3532298-A', 'US-5506780-A', 'US-5507454-A', 'US-5120008-A', 'US-5421540-A', 'US-6059233-A', 'US-5067672-A', 'US-4288051-A', 'US-T100604-I4', 'US-5433726-A', 'US-5163640-A', 'US-4618112-A', 'US-5568904-A', 'US-5681011-A', 'US-4599697-A', 'US-5595360-A', 'US-5452869-A', 'US-5064152-A']","[0.09437682, -0.21388869, 0.012310953, 0.043010145, 0.035662588, -0.07240336, 0.09417904, -0.050078325, 0.11197277, -0.079690285, -0.1725181, 0.23925234, 0.25234, -0.18556346, 0.039770063, 0.0794857, 0.03899195, 0.02479162, -0.14758849, 0.20481774, 0.10471842, 0.1511124, -0.23277174, 0.083795615, -0.0153011605, -0.12295859, 0.065968804, 0.08042685, 0.25697798, -0.13434319, 0.019184045, -0.14304245, -0.10028197, 0.13444442, -0.17006895, 0.08257693, 0.041699253, -0.2514721, 0.07959512, 0.13709177, -0.11405796, -0.16054162, 0.14027737, -0.12971658, -0.12782569, 0.05883589, -0.03314806, 0.28471702, 0.06821977, -0.061452005, -0.14866827, -0.09140331, 0.086166054, -0.0036761505, 0.012674888, -0.032081455, 0.14927073, 0.045459148, 0.047532428, 0.018620208, 0.08150524, -0.03782815, -0.08545715, 0.022605864]",True

In the absence of multipath effects, correlation pulses are generated in response to the detection of multiple transmissions of the reference code from multiple transmitters. However, multipath effects distort the generated correlation pulses leading to errors in the time of arrival measurements. The present invention calculates the width of the correlation pulses and determines a delay correction factor based on the pulse width. The delay correction factor is added to the measured delay time to provide a more accurate delay time, thus permitting more accurate location measurements based on time of arrival. In alternative embodiments, other signal factors may also be used to apply delay correction factors. The actual location determination may be performed by the mobile unit, or any other positioning determining entity (PDE). The system is also capable of applying correction factors to time of arrival signals received from global positioning system (GPS) satellites.","['455/506.', '455/65.', '375/E01.032']","['H04B1/1081', 'H04W84/06', 'G01S19/42', 'G01S19/46', 'H04W24/00', 'G01S19/428', 'G01S19/40', 'G01S5/10', 'H04B1/711', 'H04B1/7117', 'G01S19/22', 'G01S5/0273', 'G01S5/0215']","['H04W84/06', 'H04B1/00', 'G01S1/02', 'H04W24/00', 'H04B1/10', 'G01S5/02', 'G01S19/40', 'G01S5/10', 'H04W28/04', 'H04B1/7117', 'G01S19/22', 'G01S1/00', 'G01S19/42', 'H04B1/711', 'G01S19/48']","['US-6804494-B2', 'US-6198765-B1', 'US-6542754-B1']",",",True

After injection of the satellite by a launch vehicle into the transfer orbit at its perigee, with an initial attitude approximating the predetermined final attitude for the apogee motor firing, the right ascension β of the satellite is modified to confer on it an intermediate attitude such that the earth is in the field of view of the terrestrial sensors for a position of the satellite in the transfer orbit offset at least 10° from the apogee. The declination α of the rotation axis of the satellite is measured and then adjusted to the value required for the apogee motor firing. Maintaining this declination constant, the right ascension is adjusted on the basis of the solar sensor measurements so as to bring the satellite into its final attitude, and the apogee motor firing is then commanded.","['244/164.', '244/169.', '701/13.']","['B64G1/363', 'B64G1/26', 'B64G1/281', 'B64G1/24', 'B64G1/365', 'G05D1/0883']","['G06F19/00', 'B64G1/28', 'G05D1/08', 'B64G1/26', 'B64G1/36', 'B64G1/24', 'G01C21/24']","['FR-2373823-A1', 'US-4837699-A', 'EP-0209429-A1', 'US-4776540-A']",",",True

1838,US-7573807-B1,20090811,US,23575627,Method and apparatus for performing differential modulation over frequency in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication system,"A terrestrial repeater is disclosed for use in a satellite transmission system that may also include a plurality of satellites. The terrestrial repeaters are implemented as OFDM transmitters to minimize the channel impairments caused by multi-path propagation. The OFDM terrestrial repeaters differentially encode the transmitted signal over frequency, as opposed to time, in order to avoid channel phase distortion. The OFDM receiver allocates two unmodulated sub-carriers as pilot bins and thereby provides two sub-carriers as a reference within each OFDM symbol. At the OFDM receiver, the two unmodulated pilot bins contain no phase information and provide a reference for the differential demodulation performed by the OFDM receiver. The OFDM transmitter operates in two modes, namely, a normal mode and a transmitter identifier information (TII) mode. The TII mode contains all of the functions of the normal mode, and also transmits a repeater identification signal with the customer data, using the inactive OFDM sub-carriers (bins). In a normal mode, the OFDM transmitter optionally fills unused (inactive) sub-carriers with zeroes and in a TII mode, the OFDM transmitter uses at least some of the unused (inactive) sub-carriers to transmit the transmitter identifier information (TII). The predefined TII value is mapped onto a set of complex symbols. The TII signal facilitates the receiver test equipment in associating the received signal with the terrestrial repeater(s) that generate the TII signal.",['370/210.'],['H04L27/2602'],"['H04L27/26', 'H04J11/00', 'H04H20/00']","['WO-9929058-A1', 'US-6628722-B1', 'US-5825241-A', 'US-5732113-A', 'US-5920598-A', 'US-6449245-B1', 'US-6700866-B1', 'EP-0899923-A1', 'US-5063574-A', 'US-6195341-B1', 'US-6160791-A', 'US-6487252-B1', 'US-6148007-A', 'US-6618352-B1', 'US-6449246-B1', 'US-5864579-A', 'US-6130859-A', 'US-6442211-B1', 'EP-1087585-A2', 'US-6594320-B1', 'US-5771224-A']","[0.04407477, 0.104559824, 0.050612308, -0.10939001, 0.063464515, -0.054816384, -0.067515254, -0.20823342, 0.09213487, -0.12807444, -0.08520133, -0.047442824, -0.07401749, 0.004717288, 0.08645075, 0.069358565, 0.2032563, 0.14890301, -0.20590526, 0.06824087, 0.044404186, 0.06596912, 0.029909816, 0.05924333, 0.028581131, -0.041394204, 0.17055055, 0.063731246, 0.016525766, -0.1266596, -0.29142144, -0.15658554, -0.2741187, -0.11101911, 0.025622679, -0.018965691, -0.052489404, -0.21948741, -0.124669686, 0.20687827, -0.16007517, 0.10983853, 0.031107118, 0.063383214, 0.07408945, -0.036521375, 0.023790004, 0.047830112, -0.026602859, 0.13001315, -0.23303564, 0.15646178, -0.076300085, 0.10427278, -0.06414367, -0.0062441975, -0.11065346, 0.010453479, -0.20739731, 0.028795745, 0.08504172, 0.2890755, -0.18808305, 0.18174903]",True

The sets of zenith delay values for corresponding grid points are compared in the server ( 260 ) and modifications developed (preferably in fractional form) by which the non-meteorological delay values require correcting to be accurate. The correction sets are reduced by image compression techniques ( 270 ) and transmitted via the satellites ( 110   1  etc) of the GNSS at low data rate to the user receiver, which receiver simply applies the corrections to the Zenith delays derived by its own model.

When the feed element is used to feed the antenna at a proximal end portion (FIG. 4, 141), the antenna (20) functions as a quadrifilar helical antenna having a radiation pattern which exhibits desirable gain properties in the area above the antenna (FIG. 4, 40).

The receiver uses the received parameters in a numerical integration to compute the position of the satellite at a desired time. The set of parameters needed for the integration is small. To further reduce the amount of data transmitted, reference parameters may be subtracted from the original parameters before transmission from the server. The receiver is able to reconstruct the original parameters from the received parameters and the identically computed reference parameters.

The trunnions are connected to the payload support frame which may have a satellite payload therein.

The thin fabric strap allows movement with virtually no friction or suspension resistance. The strap&#39;s elastic restoring torque being very small is overcome transparently by adjusting the overturning moments in initial balancing. Because straps such as the above can only sustain tensile loads, multiple straps are used in combination angles to sustain the shear load as a result of roll rotation. The yaw axis joint may have instead a thin homogeneous material sheet to carry both shear and tensile loads.","['248/663.', '73/865.3', '73/866.4', '434/34.', '248/908.', '248/659.', '248/661.']","['Y10S248/908', 'G01M99/00']",['G01M99/00'],"['US-3344673-A', 'US-3516179-A', 'US-4114765-A', 'US-3936682-A', 'US-4148453-A', 'US-3583749-A', 'US-4562430-A', 'US-3449843-A', 'US-3923165-A', 'US-4730797-A', 'US-4803413-A', 'US-5110294-A', 'US-3281964-A', 'US-4146162-A', 'US-5022708-A', 'US-5020357-A', 'US-4619142-A', 'US-3161988-A']","[0.18790539, -0.22534794, 0.076628424, -0.042994026, 0.17387111, -0.09512639, -0.031287543, -0.006633688, 0.15793288, -0.105642475, 0.069220275, 0.24727958, 0.06403095, -0.06427423, 0.09846621, 0.30684158, 0.036873717, 0.12927784, -0.11726771, 0.12338223, 0.05426838, -0.28328663, -0.4802907, 0.057156436, 0.15653539, -0.051813066, 0.12978448, 0.13971563, 0.0037614678, 0.1044777, 0.05252364, -0.09620328, 0.029239349, 0.077504925, -0.004730712, 0.008724028, 0.07690103, -0.028005006, 0.078700244, 0.043206353, -0.096218005, -0.124861054, 0.16489974, -0.020324046, 0.030207628, 0.038431566, 0.021223206, -0.03523958, -0.03809258, -0.048628304, -0.052722726, -0.09335365, 0.031136312, -0.098950654, -0.066004016, -0.1713308, 0.17163558, 0.047739744, -0.024050435, 0.108060345, -0.09394051, 0.037710764, -0.08726882, -0.034474533]",True

A sales agent&#39;s terminal uses the algorithm and seed to produce random number combinations for each play from a pool, assigning the number combinations sequentially and printing them, together with a sequential serial number, onto lottery tickets. By storing the algorithm and seed at both the host computer and remote agent terminal, the remote terminal can transmit all pertinent wagering information by only transmitting the actual count of plays sold, thereby reducing the amount of data exchanged by several orders of magnitude. The host computer can then reconstruct the wagers and compare them to winning number combinations. Liability information for each terminal is transmitted back to the agent together with new seed numbers, so the agent terminal may begin selling plays for a new pool while also verifying accurate data exchange. The reduced data exchange makes available novel methods of data transfer, such as satellite packet transmission and cellular service.","['463/16.', '463/17.', '463/22.', '463/42.', '463/41.', '463/25.', '463/40.']","['G07F17/32', 'G07C15/006', 'A63F3/081', 'G07F17/3288', 'G06Q50/34']","['G07C15/00', 'A63F1/00', 'G06F13/14', 'H04L9/12', 'A63F3/08', 'G07F17/32', 'G06F1/02', 'G06F15/16', 'A63F5/04', 'G06Q50/34']","['US-5276312-A', 'US-5871398-A', 'US-4713787-A', 'US-4982337-A', 'US-5954582-A', 'US-4398708-A', 'US-6024640-A', 'US-5119295-A', 'US-4937853-A', 'US-5415416-A', 'US-5417424-A', 'US-4842278-A']","[-0.053600408, -0.06941681, 0.0040672817, 0.12041429, -0.0037325867, -0.010417343, 0.022156073, -0.07153578, 0.18219271, -0.020168062, 0.03815523, 0.19110385, 0.09206909, 0.036339685, 0.012516786, 0.10762681, -0.024698718, 0.20502096, -0.12933508, -0.051321384, 0.35683188, 0.06085522, 0.024416111, 0.010730871, -0.054736633, -0.09222546, 0.1683204, 0.1143451, 0.24398431, -0.19061449, 0.0526169, 0.022320883, 0.18651515, -0.058546975, -0.105219945, -0.106561944, -0.037177205, -0.3564289, -0.016644076, 0.14472786, -0.07486051, 0.02735995, 0.07505736, -0.024187583, 0.08683752, 0.13721982, -0.041888263, -0.032829005, -0.0127263395, 0.05462126, -0.081631504, 0.099684745, 0.12036698, 0.10698103, -0.15751539, -0.023670675, 0.049047746, 0.024952374, -0.28893593, 0.13703045, -0.04717871, 0.15816627, -0.13892332, 0.24127825]",True

In the course of generating the image, the system classifies each area of the land based on scan data produced by satellites measuring red and near-infrared radiation from each area of the land. The system associates a color with each land class and colors the image pixel corresponding to each area of the land with the color associated with its class. The system allows an operator to supply input calibration data controlling the color associated with each class. Through an iterative process of adjusting the calibration data so as to make colors in the land image produced by the system conform to known colors of representative areas of that land, the operator can make the system produce an accurately colored image of the entire land. The system also generates a color classification display illustrating how it relates color to land classification.

Using the impurity detector units, a portion of an incoming water stream is passed to an analyzer for detection of chlorine and various contaminants. The detector analyzes related data for determining the condition and extent of impurity in the water elements. This data is transmitted from a compact control box, known as the wall unit, that translates the data for output to the CMS, located in another geographic locale, via a common data acquisition network. This network can be the Internet or a cellular and/or satellite connection. Upon detection of contaminants above a threshold level, the monitoring device will make a sound through a wall unit located in the vicinity, to warn the average household tap water user of such unsatisfactory condition of his/her water elements, as the conditional values are sent using EDI onto the network, and then onward to the CMS website.","['73/863.01', '422/82.05', '250/493.1', '4/638.', '436/164.', '422/119.', '210/94.', '436/125.']","['C02F2101/20', 'G01N33/18', 'Y10T436/193333', 'C02F2209/29', 'C02F1/32', 'C02F1/008']","['C02F1/32', 'C02F1/00', 'G05B23/02', 'B01D17/12']","['US-6356205-B1', 'US-5191613-A', 'US-6024867-A', 'US-6290908-B1', 'US-5892690-A', 'WO-0194937-A1', 'US-5865991-A', 'US-5494573-A', 'US-5646863-A', 'US-6106705-A', 'US-6491828-B1', 'US-6245224-B1', 'US-5654201-A', 'WO-0075898-A1', 'US-6021664-A']","[-0.003311351, -0.011804844, -0.1345788, 0.09375808, 0.029098496, -0.10596985, 0.071130745, 0.042093176, 0.17669012, -0.019885434, -0.11073555, 0.10051987, 0.12551574, 0.022467583, 0.044014685, 0.00095852365, 0.20763695, 0.0428588, 0.07737502, 0.2823215, 0.23700558, -0.08897012, 0.0030407442, -0.109525286, -0.069799475, -0.0060004946, 0.16267091, 0.08292996, -0.011233294, -0.169864, 0.13143556, 0.004085732, 0.09477687, -0.24884985, 0.025677186, -0.060207635, 0.06783943, -0.21397483, -0.11500357, -0.008192397, -0.08162302, -0.092954785, 0.044614993, 0.01428507, 0.09380272, 0.011718019, -0.023384538, -0.14963129, -0.13265131, -0.008383908, -0.07538384, 0.04298555, -0.12192983, 0.014930535, 0.2665427, 0.07213478, 0.15272032, -0.023188358, -0.28298363, 0.23394437, -0.14311948, 0.29086068, -0.14264116, 0.041567575]",True

The logging device is coupled to the position measurement device for recording data received from the position measurement device. The logging device records the data at a current logging rate. The positioning system receiver detects an event via an external sensor or with reference to satellite data, for example. In response to the event, the logging device automatically modifies data logging processing such as the current logging rate. Additionally, to allow a post processing system to go backwards in time relative to the event, the current logging rate may be increased for a predetermined amount of time preceding the occurrence of the event.

A receiver in the system includes a directional antenna that is focused on the signals transmitted by the geostationary satellite. The antenna rejects multipath signals, and the receiver thus tracks the satellite signal directly, without having to compensate for multipath distortion. Once the receiver is tracking the code and carrier, the receiver decodes the transmitted data to recover timing information, as well as satellite orbital correction information and an ionospheric model, or table, transmitted by the satellite. The receiver then uses the decoded information and timing pulses provided in synchronism with the transmitted PRN code to produce a corrected timing signal. The timing signal is provided to drive a reference clock that produces a system time signal that is essentially as stable as the Cesium clock signals utilized by the WAAS system.","['342/357.48', '701/469.', '342/357.42']","['G01S19/215', 'G01S19/235']","['G01S19/11', 'G01S1/00', 'G01S19/05']","['US-H1618-H', 'US-5621646-A', 'US-5623414-A', 'US-5731786-A', 'US-5736960-A', 'US-5760738-A', 'US-4704735-A', 'US-5036523-A', 'US-5952960-A', 'US-4336542-A', 'US-4445118-A']","[-0.122392885, 0.08740432, -0.121225074, -0.030502137, -0.017550971, -0.09773848, -0.021728331, -0.09037073, 0.06875027, -0.11946398, -0.20184833, 0.04878092, 0.10369581, -0.03531832, -0.0057276743, 0.053134575, 0.1961837, -0.008475901, -0.1814158, 0.10360377, 0.04016082, 0.0041944087, 0.01622227, 0.2969022, 0.0014621572, 0.0188745, 0.09663942, 0.30606967, 0.21329843, -0.15277758, 0.09857082, -0.25174046, -0.10471555, -0.03933521, 0.044809163, 0.013072508, 0.020273454, -0.18640098, -0.18751727, 0.22733174, -0.16397542, -0.09311238, 0.08213607, 0.056422684, 0.06506576, 0.11624655, -0.07291973, 0.1346254, -0.08368726, 0.015245269, -0.12025931, 0.013483498, 0.014189652, 0.03419357, -0.025941344, -0.03491452, 0.0722067, 0.08494575, -0.069003634, 0.111119725, 0.057175532, 0.19468167, -0.33357775, 0.1350328]",True

The CCD operates at a much faster overall rate than conventional CCD&#39;s, while paradoxically slowing down the readout rate of the pixels. Lower power consumption is required, less heat is generated, thermal noise is lower, and digital noise is lower. The novel CCD is capable of 10-25 μsec timing resolution (or even faster). The configuration entirely eliminates the (formerly) rate-determining step of transferring data &#34;horizontally&#34; from the &#34;top&#34; of the CCD columns. Instead, the charges on columns are transferred either &#34;up&#34; or &#34;down&#34; in an alternating manner. For example, the charges in odd-numbered columns might be transferred one row &#34;up&#34; with each clock cycle, and charges in even-numbered columns might be transferred &#34;down.&#34; This alternating charge transfer architecture is termed &#34;bi-directional.&#34; There is no &#34;horizontal&#34; transfer of data off the chip; rather, each column outputs to a separate amplifier, preferably located on-chip. There is no need for a shutter in a low flux setting, although a shutter could be used for a high flux application. Without a shutter, the readout from each column is continual, without interruption; i.e., there is no &#34;dead time&#34; when light is not being detected. Assuming that light impinges on adjacent pixels in at least two different columns, the position and time of incoming light is reconstructed from the readouts of adjacent columns. The position of the impinging light is determined as the midpoint of readouts from adjacent columns; and the time of light arrival is proportional to the difference in readout from the adjacent columns. Unlike a conventional CCD, in a fast-timing, bi-directional CCD the clock time equals the time resolution of the overall image. Thus a relatively slow clock time of 10 μsec provides a very fast image time resolution of 10 μsec. In comparison to the 30 msec time resolution that is characteristic of conventional CCD&#39;s, the fast-timing bi-directional CCD can have a time resolution at least three orders of magnitude faster. The need for fast horizontal clocking is eliminated, as is the need for cooling. The fastest existing conventional CCD&#39;s can have a readout rate of about 10 6  pixels per second. The novel fast-timing CCD&#39;s can have a readout rate of 10 7  pixels per second, or even higher. Although the readout architecture of the novel fast-timing bi-directional CCD&#39;s is new, no new fabrication technologies are needed to construct the novel CCD&#39;s.","['257/231.', '257/239.', '257/241.', '257/E27.154', '257/240.']",['H01L27/14831'],['H01L27/148'],"['US-4744057-A', 'US-5340977-A', 'US-4165539-A']",",",False

In response to requests from the PGPS Client, the PGPS Server produces and disseminates an initial seed dataset consisting of current satellite orbit state vectors and orbit propagation model coefficients. This seed dataset enables the PGPS Client to locally predict and propagate satellite orbits to a desired future time. This predictive assistance in turn helps accelerate Time To First Fix (TTFF), optimize position solution calculations and improve the sensitivity of the GPS chip present on, or coupled with, the device. In contrast with other conventional predicted GPS systems that forward large volumes of predicted orbits, synthetic ephemeris or synthetic almanac data, this method optimally reduces data transfer requirements to the client, and enables the client to locally synthesize its own predicted assistance data as needed. This method also supports seamless notification of real-time satellite integrity events and seamless integration of predicted assistance data with industry standard real-time assistance data.","['342/357.64', '342/357.66']","['G01C21/20', 'H04W4/02', 'G01S19/258', 'G01S19/05', 'G01S19/27']","['G01S19/27', 'G01S19/25']","['US-6542820-B2', 'US-6829535-B2', 'US-6907224-B2', 'US-7612712-B2', 'US-6606346-B2', 'US-2005140545-A1', 'US-6590527-B2', 'US-2006195262-A1', 'US-6219385-B1', 'US-7043363-B2', 'US-2008284646-A1', 'US-2008311870-A1', 'US-2008129593-A1', 'US-6304216-B1', 'US-7091904-B2', 'US-6703972-B2', 'US-6417801-B1', 'US-2008018527-A1', 'JP-2003021672-A', 'US-5909381-A', 'US-6704651-B2', 'US-6915208-B2', 'US-7302225-B2', 'US-6018313-A', 'US-7009555-B2', 'US-5689270-A', 'US-7132980-B2', 'WO-2008055223-A2', 'US-6519466-B2', 'US-7158080-B2', 'US-6133872-A', 'US-2006282216-A1', 'US-5774829-A', 'US-6937187-B2', 'US-6560534-B2', 'US-2008291086-A1', 'US-2007273581-A1', 'US-6651000-B2', 'US-2005231423-A1', 'US-6236365-B1', 'US-2008111738-A1', 'US-6035202-A', 'US-6389291-B1', 'US-2006038719-A1']","[-0.05354618, -0.12841009, -9.4763105e-05, 0.1099798, 0.05194413, -0.19482993, 0.018904129, -0.06724322, 0.060855977, -0.07574244, -0.13652956, 0.14893383, 0.22736704, -0.07972551, 0.018797666, 0.030699098, 0.13959226, -0.01944788, -0.18868516, 0.04820333, 0.16952851, -0.061829023, -0.0871675, 0.056119163, -0.14672743, -0.07184434, 0.07288083, 0.24395256, 0.14563805, -0.09849158, 0.13382062, -0.06759867, -0.05668949, -0.110998, -0.12251479, 0.13190912, -0.1452762, -0.13412935, -0.17163412, 0.06684697, -0.26127264, -0.16031773, -0.039444484, 0.15882559, 0.12625581, 0.050414972, 0.1739576, 0.010290428, -0.083891, 0.07734025, -0.16988362, 0.05700927, -0.0139708435, 0.23282866, 0.007361994, -0.15666302, 0.06667602, -0.07026676, -0.12861666, -0.0042322767, 0.04389484, 0.28158215, -0.20665461, 0.053289108]",True

A hardware circuit is incorporated with that crystal to mirror that same characteristic. A temperature sensor is used to control a compensation applied. The combination outputs a fairly flat temperature response, e.g., near zero delta-frequency change over the operating temperature range. But this flat response has an unknown offset from the true frequency. A next step finds a precision timing reference, such as when the receiver locks onto and tracks GPS satellites. The receiver then knows time precisely and a navigation software can compute the offset accurately. A value is stored for that offset in memory. Such value is thereafter recalled at each cold start and is used by software to remove the expected frequency offset.",['342/357.62'],"['H03L1/026', 'G01S19/235', 'H03L7/18', 'H03J1/005']","['G01S19/23', 'G01S1/00']","['US-7010307-B2', 'US-5629708-A', 'US-6509870-B1']",",",True

Each color map address corresponds to a predefined set of features and descriptive information about those features. Since the pixel bit map defines a color map address for each location on the image, suitable programming of the color map can insure proper correlation of descriptive information with corresponding locations on the image. The correlation between color map addresses and the descriptive information about the features is represented most compactly by arranging or sorting the entries in the color map so that there is a correspondence between each predefined feature and a continuous range of color map addresses.

The filtering trees correspond to the logical expressions of one or more query-based definitions, and represent the structure of the computer-executable instructions for comparing events with the definitions. The filtering trees can be traversed so as to simultaneously compare the parameters of an event against multiple logical expressions. The filtering tree is traversed in a top to bottom cascading fashion until a leaf node is encountered in a process that is conceptually equivalent to processing the logical operations associated with the nodes. When a leaf node is encountered, an ordered set of logical values associated with the leaf node indicates which, if any, of the definitions are satisfied by the event. The filtering definitions can be conveniently used to filter events detected by event providers in a computer system so as to identify the event that are to be reported to event subscribers.","['710/104.', '715/804.', '715/853.', '707/713.', '709/219.', '706/45.', '711/110.', '707/797.', '707/754.', '715/205.', '707/999.101', '707/954.', '707/999.002', '706/50.', '707/999.005', '719/321.', '707/999.003']","['Y10S707/954', 'G06F17/30516', 'Y10S707/99933', 'Y10S707/99935', 'Y10S707/99942', 'Y10S707/99932']",['G06F17/30'],"['US-5937401-A', 'US-5574910-A', 'US-5806061-A', 'US-6078924-A']",",",False

2023,US-6804494-B2,20041012,US,25373385,System and method for the detection and compensation of radio signal time of arrival errors,"A system and method are disclosed by which the effects of time of arrival errors may be reduced. In a mobile unit, such as a CDMA device, a correlation pulse is generated when a transmitted code matches a stored reference code. In the absence of multipath effects, correlation pulses are generated in response to the detection of multiple transmissions of the reference code from multiple transmitters. However, multipath effects distort the generated correlation pulses leading to errors in the time of arrival measurements. The present invention calculates the width of the correlation pulses and determines a delay correction factor based on the pulse width. The delay correction factor is added to the measured delay time to provide a more accurate delay time, thus permitting more accurate location measurements based on time of arrival. In alternative embodiments, other signal factors may also be used to apply delay correction factors. The actual location determination may be performed by the mobile unit, or any other positioning determining entity (PDE). The system is also capable of applying correction factors to time of arrival signals received from global positioning system (GPS) satellites.","['455/65.', '455/456.1', '455/504.', '375/E01.032']","['H04B1/1081', 'H04B1/7117', 'H04W84/06', 'G01S19/46', 'H04W24/00', 'G01S19/40', 'G01S19/428', 'G01S5/10', 'G01S5/0273', 'G01S5/0215', 'G01S19/22', 'G01S19/42', 'H04B1/711']","['H04W84/06', 'G01S1/02', 'H04W24/00', 'H04B1/10', 'G01S5/02', 'G01S19/40', 'G01S5/10', 'H04W28/04', 'H04B1/7117', 'G01S19/22', 'G01S1/00', 'G01S19/42', 'H04B1/711', 'G01S19/48']","['US-2001002203-A1', 'US-6198765-B1', 'US-2002183069-A1', 'US-5945948-A']","[-0.19367583, 0.09993769, -0.086543284, -0.031702008, 0.03126086, 0.05170954, -0.09415044, -0.078470476, 0.08777756, -0.046427745, -0.052634154, 0.07132951, 0.08602, -0.12527628, 0.013981821, 0.03307942, 0.04680091, 0.013067833, -0.20527901, 0.111826494, 0.22331452, -0.07051978, -0.039745715, 0.21651259, -0.09287327, 0.017333701, 0.20692001, 0.22644687, 0.16466466, 0.05192831, 0.10085474, -0.21233213, -0.16092403, -0.046868954, 0.09317024, 0.0029559452, -0.115170345, -0.26983306, -0.12094498, 0.13649274, -0.12543562, -0.14015959, 0.11377739, 0.1480778, 0.1394126, -0.005308162, 0.18178265, 0.13014688, -0.018702108, -0.04227689, -0.10717303, 0.07796029, 0.009012157, -0.12449871, -0.082941175, 0.0692539, 0.12999094, 0.05263129, -0.079222485, 0.07851237, -0.019372143, 0.35968083, -0.12611426, 0.11962485]",True

An avatar is a virtual representation of an individual or group as a Global Information Bus (GIB) software service with which other services can interact (i.e., proxy of person). Thus, a service needing to contact a person need not know who that person is. Each avatar includes means for reaching and communicating with the individual wherever they are in the global ecosystem. An avatar is the virtualization of service methods translated to user actions. In short, an avatar is an object personification of the attributes of a person, team, group, or the like, which represents specific qualities associated with the subject of the avatar. Operators, provisions, customer contacts, service support staff and any other management-tasked staff in the customer and network care environment will have an avatar(s) for a network management task manager, such as a Management Operations Canter (MOC). An avatar&#39;s virtual image may also represent a history of past work, interactions, success ratings associated with personification of the subject of the avatar. along with its current workload and contact information for forwarding all communications, messages and work to the contact via the appropriate contact mean(s)interacting with the avatar. Initially, an avatar object registers itself as, for example as a contact entity within a DataBus, with a registry within the domain of a service which may need the contact data. Any service requesting information associated with the avatar object locates this proxy using existing NewWave protocols, and then communicates with the avatar through its proxy. In accordance with one embodiment, a service invite a person to participate in a work group based on the needs of the service and attributes of the avatar and then bind their avatar to an associated work document. As the work proceeds, the avatar attributes are updated to reflect its workload and upon completion of the task the avatar&#39;s its history is updated to reflect the its association with the particular task and the success rating of the completion of the task.","['705/7.42', '705/7.14']","['H04L41/0672', 'G06Q10/06314', 'H04L67/24', 'H04L29/12141', 'G06Q10/1093', 'H04L41/0233', 'H04L63/102', 'G06Q20/3829', 'H04L41/0893', 'H04L67/22', 'H04L63/08', 'H04L41/0856', 'G06Q10/063112', 'H04L67/42', 'G06Q40/00', 'H04L61/1558', 'H04L41/5041', 'Y10S707/99931', 'H04L41/0663', 'H04L41/5058', 'G06Q10/06398', 'H04L67/34', 'H04L67/16', 'H04L67/1095', 'H04L63/123', 'H04L41/0843', 'G06Q10/10', 'H04L67/2842']","['H04L12/24', 'H04L29/08', 'H04L29/06', 'G06Q20/38', 'G06Q10/10', 'H04L29/12', 'G06Q40/00', 'G06Q10/06']","['US-6222856-B1', 'US-5515531-A', 'US-6978006-B1', 'US-6219045-B1', 'US-6170011-B1', 'US-6223165-B1', 'US-5774661-A', 'US-5014266-A', 'US-5737727-A', 'US-7051212-B2', 'US-6405367-B1', 'US-5615121-A', 'US-6385626-B1', 'US-5111391-A', 'US-6842779-B1', 'US-6859523-B1', 'US-6064667-A', 'US-6237009-B1', 'US-6718515-B1', 'US-5019961-A', 'US-5751706-A', 'US-6684087-B1', 'US-6574229-B1', 'US-6356632-B1', 'US-2003120829-A1', 'US-6684331-B1', 'US-5526353-A', 'US-5918229-A', 'US-6684136-B2', 'US-7552056-B2', 'US-5734837-A', 'US-140119-A', 'US-6346956-B2', 'US-7769160-B1', 'US-6564216-B2', 'US-2001054064-A1', 'US-6757912-B1', 'US-6209018-B1', 'US-5873093-A', 'US-6557003-B1', 'US-5721913-A', 'US-5749075-A', 'US-6188683-B1', 'US-6226666-B1', 'US-6044355-A', 'US-5117353-A', 'US-6078581-A', 'US-6901518-B1', 'US-6523027-B1', 'US-43600-A', 'US-5884029-A', 'US-5721770-A', 'US-6970829-B1', 'US-7383332-B2', 'US-6349238-B1', 'US-6024643-A', 'US-6574633-B1', 'US-6735293-B2', 'US-6842799-B2', 'US-6560656-B1', 'US-5008878-A', 'US-7023979-B1', 'US-5920846-A', 'US-6381640-B1', 'US-5779297-A', 'US-6052711-A', 'US-6078582-A', 'US-6185611-B1', 'US-6536935-B2', 'US-7194543-B2', 'US-5867494-A', 'US-7792773-B2', 'US-91827-A', 'US-2002069272-A1', 'US-6353398-B1', 'US-6403564-B1', 'US-6029195-A', 'US-2004073601-A1', 'US-6049776-A', 'US-6862594-B1', 'US-5761499-A', 'US-5926539-A', 'US-6697848-B2', 'US-6850895-B2', 'US-6263066-B1', 'US-6011918-A', 'US-5872841-A', 'US-6868441-B2', 'US-6732165-B1', 'US-6880007-B1', 'US-6380951-B1', 'US-6070142-A', 'US-6363065-B1', 'US-6223182-B1', 'US-5765140-A', 'US-2006031237-A1', 'US-6633900-B1', 'US-7020619-B2', 'US-3058-A', 'US-2002077876-A1', 'US-6401109-B1', 'US-5608786-A', 'US-188720-A', 'US-5726984-A', 'US-6225998-B1', 'US-5724412-A', 'US-91703-A']",",",False

Autonomously obtained navigational data provide a measurement of the actual orbit in which the satellite is traveling. So long as the measured orbit conforms to a desired orbit to within a preselected tolerance, periodic corrections of equal magnitude are made to the satellite&#39;s velocity, based on a prediction of the effect of atmospheric drag on the orbit. Measurement of the orbit is made by observation of the time that the satellite passes a reference point in the orbit, such as by crossing the ascending node. If the measured orbit departs from the desired orbit by more than the preselected tolerance, a velocity correction of a magnitude different from the one based on prediction is applied to the satellite. For a decaying orbit, the magnitude of the velocity correction is increased above the correction value based on prediction. For a rising orbit, the magnitude of the velocity correction is decreased below the value based on prediction, and may be reduced to zero, allowing atmospheric drag to bring the measured orbit back within the preselected tolerance range.","['244/158.8', '244/164.', '342/354.', '244/165.', '701/531.', '701/13.', '342/352.', '244/169.', '342/355.']","['B64G1/24', 'G05D1/0883', 'B64G1/26', 'B64G1/36']","['B64G1/24', 'G05D1/08', 'B64G1/26', 'B64G1/36']","['US-5050087-A', 'US-4161780-A', 'US-5227802-A', 'US-5267167-A', 'US-4730798-A', 'US-3944172-A', 'US-4288051-A', 'US-5222023-A', 'US-4617634-A', 'US-5326054-A', 'US-5163641-A', 'US-4358076-A', 'US-5132910-A', 'US-4958788-A', 'US-4776540-A', 'US-5054719-A', 'US-4102958-A', 'US-3866025-A', 'US-5109346-A', 'US-4837699-A', 'US-5279483-A', 'US-4599697-A', 'US-4911385-A']",",",True

Customers preselect from a list of available music in advance using an interactive screen selector, and pay only for music that they choose to playback for their enjoyment. An antipiracy “ID tag” is woven into the recorded music so that any illegal copies therefrom may be traced to the purchase transaction. Music is transmitted on a fixed schedule or through an active scheduling process that monitors music requests from all or a subset of satellite receivers and adjust scheduling according to demand for various CD&#39;s.

A Kalman filter with a short (˜0.5 second) time constant provides data at a sufficient rate (e.g., ˜10 Hz) to enable real-time flight with the system. With the additional availability of measured or estimated angle of attack, this system can also display conventional roll and pitch attitude angles.

2094,US-2006228029-A1,20061012,US,37083229,Method and system for video clip compression,"In a method for compressing a video clip containing audio content and image content, an image and/or an audio portion of individual video frames of the video clip are analyzed. Next frame scores are calculated for the video frames.

The reusable repair vehicle can be moved from one orbit to another with minimal energy expense while not having to wait for a launch window. Once a servicing need is identified, a destination orbit is identified for the space vehicle and a minimum energy path is identified. If the time to the next launch window between the docking orbit and the destination orbit happens to be near enough to allow for a timely rendezvous, the space vehicle is moved directly to the destination orbit. The space vehicle can be a vehicle designed to be piloted by humans or telerobotically. In one implementation, the inactive space vehicle is docked in an Intermediate LEO orbit (altitudes of approximately 250 km to approximately 500 km) and is used to rendezvous with objects in High LEO orbits (altitudes of approximately 500 km to approximately 1500 km) or objects in Low LEO orbits (altitudes of approximately 250 km or less). The space vehicle can be a modified lunar lander.","['244/158.6', '244/172.5']","['B64G1/007', 'B64G1/242']","['B64G1/24', 'B64G1/00']","['US-5595360-A', 'US-6017000-A', 'US-5394561-A', 'US-6182928-B1', 'US-4754601-A', 'US-5199672-A', 'US-5170485-A', 'US-5961077-A', 'US-4872015-A', 'US-4943014-A', 'US-5372340-A', 'US-4896847-A', 'US-6149104-A', 'US-5551624-A']","[0.20224915, -0.18804525, 0.051494204, -0.074346855, 0.018411143, 0.08258541, 0.032582, -0.010357709, 0.15609972, -0.139307, -0.19568464, 0.1687203, 0.18647517, -0.13753723, 0.021098906, 0.18790974, 0.03679593, 0.114107996, -0.19764908, 0.16673945, 0.1564229, 0.04713071, -0.23471393, -0.053594287, 0.17806603, -0.11909304, -0.039565746, 0.030729914, 0.2089408, -0.12954558, 0.10255549, -0.08453217, -0.17546542, 0.08850346, -0.14647657, 0.16860098, 0.047040686, -0.21427968, 0.1557819, 0.106823534, -0.007453933, -0.06966476, 0.12540737, -0.17022412, 0.01741907, 0.0467088, 0.03146664, 0.18952002, -0.015112627, 0.068195924, -0.0784746, -0.13274913, -0.044599727, -0.054952677, 0.13006195, -0.25726634, 0.09548293, -0.092616655, -0.040261354, 0.08858412, 0.00085415185, 0.04269924, -0.02601455, 0.08428144]",True

The tropospheric refraction effect can be largely removed by modeling, and if desired, can be improved by the use of small stochastic adjustments included in the computation of the clock correction. After removing the above error factors, satellite clock corrections are computed for individual reference stations, and an average clock correction is formed for each of a plurality of satellites by taking an average or weighted average of the satellite clock corrections over reference stations to which the satellite is visible.","['342/357.31', '714/746.', '701/472.']","['G01S19/41', 'G01S19/07']","['G01S5/14', 'G01S19/41', 'G01S19/07', 'G01C21/26', 'G01S1/00', 'G06F11/00', 'G01S19/48']","['US-5621646-A', 'US-5899957-A', 'US-5471217-A', 'US-5828336-A', 'EP-0609935-A2', 'US-6266009-B1', 'US-6215441-B1']",",",True

A radio occultation system includes a transmitter system, a receiver system, and a post-processing system. The receiver system receives the radio signal that is transmitted by the transmitter system through the earth&#39;s atmosphere, where it is occulted, and down converts the received radio occultation signal to generate a down converted signal based on a phase model that uses a refractivity climatology. The receiver system then low pass filters the down converted signal and samples the in-phase and quadrature components of the down converted and low pass filtered signal. The post-processing system receives the in-phase and quadrature components of the down converted and low pass filtered signal, determines the mean residual frequency, and performs additional down conversion of the sampled signal to eliminate aliasing. The post-processing system then re-samples the down converted signal at a higher sampling rate and calculates the accumulated phase and amplitude from the re-sampled signal.","['455/189.1', '455/427.', '455/12.1']","['G01S19/14', 'G01W1/08', 'G01W1/02', 'G01S19/29']",['G01S1/00'],"['US-5675081-A', 'US-2001012318-A1', 'US-6134282-A', 'US-6028887-A', 'US-2002155809-A1', 'US-5579347-A', 'US-6263028-B1']","[-0.09895029, 0.048692062, -0.11386379, -0.060982693, 0.07474688, -0.07848904, -0.0004435075, -0.1269502, 0.20987272, -0.036153607, 0.007250872, 0.101356514, 0.21927655, -0.10173349, 0.06644445, 0.015429322, 0.16923007, 0.057912674, -0.19113806, 0.13344389, 0.20667173, -0.050154556, -0.08617751, 0.05469411, 0.066906735, 0.09375709, 0.0151425, 0.17330101, 0.13875656, -0.032629497, 0.0653881, -0.17549227, -0.24822646, -0.13535094, 0.074283145, -0.0058280854, 0.07994856, -0.11574887, -0.1781907, 0.13892928, -0.24809463, -0.15918608, 0.055308994, -0.046530027, 0.0018306953, -0.038340457, 0.049089137, 0.19030759, -0.049853235, 0.18561684, 0.016082529, -0.13402824, -0.017845968, 0.13408849, 0.07895434, -0.021309609, 0.16343199, 0.06414354, -0.07318196, 0.22480333, 0.047970116, 0.22555867, -0.20329587, 0.1835957]",True

2131,US-8542146-B2,20130924,US,40591689,Generalized partial fixing,"Described is a generalized approach for integer parameter estimation, especially in the context of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). The problem solved is the case where a definitively correct integer solution cannot be identified for all ambiguity parameters in a reliable way. The proposed solution is to apply a linear transformation to the ambiguities (multiply with a matrix) such that the images of the first and the second candidate (or more) are identical. That way, from the first and second (and possibly more) candidates of the integer least-squares solution, a subset of ambiguity combinations is derived that can be fixed. Thus, it is no longer necessary to choose between the solutions as they coincide for the new ambiguities. The advantage of this approach is maximizing all information still available when finally deriving additional parameters such as position, clock error, atmospheric errors and/or time correlated noise. This technique is applicable to real-time and post-processing applications, as well as to pure GNSS applications, GNSS integrated with other sensors (e.g. INS) and other applications that have to resolve multiple integer ambiguities. This may also apply to optical distance-measurement. GNSS applications include kinematic and static positioning with single base stations as well as with multiple base stations or reference station networks. They also comprise the integer parameter estimation methods used within the reference station network computations.","['342/357.38', '342/357.27']",['G01S19/44'],"['G01S5/14', 'G01S19/44', 'G01S19/55']","['US-5991691-A', 'US-7538721-B2', 'US-6731701-B2', 'US-6753810-B1', 'US-6229479-B1', 'US-5914685-A', 'US-7312747-B2', 'US-7432853-B2', 'US-5825326-A', 'US-7102563-B2', 'US-6934632-B2', 'US-5610614-A', 'US-6441780-B1', 'US-7589668-B2', 'US-5572218-A']",",",True

The spread spectrum receiver is designed for use in conjunction with a global positioning system (GPS) receiver, and operates to receive broadcast differential GPS correction information. The present frequency synthesis technique contemplates generating a sequence of timing signals within the GPS receiver on the basis of GPS satellite signals received thereby, and providing the timing signals to the signal receiver. Within the signal receiver, the signal cycles of a local oscillator occurring between ones of the timing signals are counted. The frequency of the local oscillator is then determined by dividing the counted cycles of the local oscillator by one of the known time intervals. The determined frequency of output signals produced by the local oscillator is then scaled so as necessary to produce the reference signal of desired frequency. This allows precisely controlled reference frequencies to be obtained irrespective of the existence of frequency instability within the local oscillator. In a preferred implementation, the stable reference signals are employed during acquisition of differential GPS correction signals received by the spread spectrum receiver. In particular, the desired reference frequency is incrementally adjusted during the process of searching for and acquiring the exact frequency of the incident differential GPS correction signals. The spread spectrum receiver is disposed to provide differential GPS correction information extracted from the acquired differential GPS correction signals to the GPS receiver.","['342/357.52', '375/147.', '342/352.', '342/357.44']",['H03L7/00'],"['G01S1/00', 'H03L7/00']","['US-4928106-A', 'US-5420592-A', 'EP-0762654-A1', 'US-5440313-A', 'US-5043736-B1', 'US-5153599-A', 'EP-0564220-A2', 'WO-9428433-A1', 'US-5043736-A', 'US-4112372-A', 'US-5003553-A', 'US-5222099-A']",",",True

A negligibly small maneuver can then bring it back to the Earth on a reverse BCT to the desired Earth inclination. Another maneuver puts it into the new ellipse at the earth. In the case of satellites launched from Vandenberg AFB into LEO in a circular orbit of an altitude of 700 km with an inclination of 34°, approximately 6 km/s is required to change the inclination to 90°.

In one or more embodiments, the client, e.g., a GPS receiver, receives a set of parameters for a satellite from the server via a wireless or wired connection. The set of parameters includes a force parameter, initial condition parameters and time correction coefficients for the satellite. The receiver uses the received parameters in a numerical integration to compute the position of the satellite at a desired time. The set of parameters needed for the integration is small compared to current methods which require sending more data to the client. Thus these parameters require less communication resources to transmit. To further reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, reference parameters may be subtracted from the original parameters before transmission from the server. The receiver is able to reconstruct the original parameters from the received parameters and the identically computed reference parameters. The parameters may be further compressed using data compression techniques.","['701/400.', '342/357.64', '342/357.66']","['G01S19/05', 'G01S19/27', 'G01S19/25']","['G01C21/00', 'G01S19/25']","['US-7839331-B2', 'US-5963167-A', 'US-6437734-B1', 'US-6157621-A', 'US-5490076-A', 'US-2007024496-A1', 'WO-0013971-A2', 'US-6085128-A', 'WO-0116618-A1']","[-0.030597972, 0.0071596373, -0.0766063, -0.06830274, 0.06749858, -0.11129748, 0.05822564, -0.073019646, 0.11264648, 0.036274966, -0.17343415, 0.009735334, 0.15250419, -0.078457855, -0.07315147, 0.122174606, 0.086608574, 0.10597705, -0.16603965, 0.08837321, 0.075546294, -0.0712632, -0.0023020587, 0.064642005, -0.117312476, -0.1086996, 0.0550554, 0.2130716, 0.18536079, -0.12901403, 0.14035857, -0.1189702, -0.09207391, -0.021345647, -0.0025426424, 0.021260893, -0.07536227, -0.23792316, -0.1340129, 0.16089499, -0.30255747, -0.22932214, 0.086388834, 0.09951112, -0.031764824, 0.023459785, 0.13024893, 0.12733622, 0.061467748, 0.087128825, -0.16982214, 0.05410874, 0.024561666, 0.1611843, 0.049845904, -0.052976567, 0.24482861, -0.043312687, -0.19623975, 0.10983907, 0.097171046, 0.27980077, -0.19151889, 0.13199836]",True
2165,US-5379045-A,19950103,US,22361367,SATPS mapping with angle orientation calibrator,"Mobile system apparatus for accurately determining the location of a designated object, spaced apart from the apparatus, without having to approach the designated object. The invention uses a Satellite Positioning System (SATPS), such as GPS or GLONASS, to determine the SATPS location of a first reference SATPS station, whose location is known with high accuracy, and of a second mobile SATPS station. The second mobile SATPS station uses two SATPS signal antennas, spaced apart a known distance but arbitrarily oriented. SATPS antennas at the first and second SATPS stations each receive SATPS signals from a plurality of SATPS satellites that can be used to determine the location of each antenna. The location of each SATPS antenna may be determined using differential corrections for the location of the first SATPS station antenna. The locations of the two SATPS signal antennas at the second SATPS station define a baseline for purposes of determination angular orientation. This angular orientation information, plus information provided by angle and range readouts for the designated object from a rangefinder positioned adjacent to the second SATPS station, allows determination of the location of the designated object without requiring use of magnetic field-dependent instruments such as magnetic compasses that may be inaccurate when used adjacent to metal structures or sources of intense electromagnetic fields. Another approach uses triangulation of the designated object location from two or more spaced apart known locations of the second SATPS station and does not require angular orientation information. Information on the location of the designated object can be processed at the second SATPS station, at the first SATPS station, or at any other place that has SATPS signal processing equipment.","['342/357.52', '342/357.36', '342/352.']","['G01S19/07', 'G01C15/00']","['G01S19/53', 'G01S19/14', 'G01S5/14', 'G01C15/00', 'G01S5/00']","['US-5233357-A', 'US-5252982-A', 'US-4949089-A', 'US-5194871-A', 'US-5185610-A']","[0.018742558, 0.07188681, -0.083175585, -0.0019174503, 0.05371218, 0.065101154, -0.008481265, -0.11074007, 0.0813337, -0.10969607, -0.16580729, 0.26221335, 0.1719465, -0.026006281, -0.09759587, 0.019691333, 0.082744814, -0.03275434, -0.26290825, 0.20974198, 0.13119218, -0.08086602, -0.09745712, 0.15022016, -0.0042871507, -0.08162184, 0.077573866, 0.3484329, 0.090639435, 0.08401351, 0.24211553, -0.16920543, -0.06827543, -0.054925866, -0.019097459, 0.0657253, 0.021341335, -0.27226725, -0.03955236, 0.04163426, -0.27853966, -0.1329866, -0.006172199, 0.13491161, -0.06082676, -0.114204556, -0.043574423, 0.096681625, 0.039624248, 0.009771864, 0.05900368, -0.14218634, -0.052058924, 0.09571949, 0.064155184, -0.024911825, 0.15198264, 0.20454596, -0.037751045, 0.015891012, -0.10063455, 0.08639112, -0.20079854, 0.036509883]",True

Power requirements are further reduced by use of very low power high accuracy time and frequency circuits in GPS based tracking units. The microprocessor based GPS tracking system is shut down almost all the time, using extremely little electrical power, and is powered up for very short periods of time at scheduled intervals by an extremely low power clock circuit with accuracy that varies with temperature. Each time the microprocessor is powered up, system temperature is recorded in memory. At times when the microprocessor is powered up, the GPS system is accessed and the GPS standard time is read. The difference between the low power clock circuit based time and the GPS based time is correlated with the recorded temperature history. A correction table, built from this data, provides a temperature history based correction to the low power clock based circuit without reference to the GPS system, and provides a highly accurate time standard. An additional table constructed in the microprocessor temperature compensates the local frequency standard used for frequency synthesis in satellite communication channels. This table is constructed by measuring offset between the calculated and actual synthesized frequency required to lock onto the satellite transmitted reference (pilot tone), and correlating this measured offset with the system ambient temperature.","['342/357.74', '342/357.62', '331/66.']","['G01S19/34', 'G01S19/235']",['G01S1/00'],"['US-5594453-A', 'US-5654718-A']","[-0.016414316, 0.11207256, -0.20864749, -0.13356745, 0.11326057, -0.04991204, 0.1470288, -0.00036281222, 0.12625273, 0.028737325, -0.08221302, 0.03839856, 0.24445249, 0.016087668, -0.026636275, 0.051796462, -0.026316518, -0.032212757, -0.20109074, 0.20353049, 0.22585614, -0.02632208, -0.007829984, 0.056350872, 0.046998367, 0.113506116, 0.09541219, 0.16234306, 0.19304976, -0.04132512, 0.022347447, -0.2615682, -0.075071104, -0.031891085, -0.05444166, 0.08994996, -0.0718735, -0.18505184, -0.1835948, 0.11661238, -0.12654102, -0.091296375, 0.12510613, 0.073626734, 0.091501676, 0.13864717, 0.10465168, 0.1508038, 0.059509013, 0.19639227, -0.05936016, -0.008998928, -0.034320593, 0.1434892, 0.033070363, 0.041726578, 0.1516741, 0.09784992, 0.030934175, 0.1804281, 0.110399164, 0.2664063, -0.2339966, 0.13423514]",True

An absolute pseudorange correction (PRC) is defined for each satellite as a function of a particular user&#39;s location. A map of the function is constructed, with &#34;iso-PRC&#34; contours. The network measures the PRCs at a few points, so-called reference stations and constructs an iso-PRC map for each satellite. Corrections are interpolated for each user&#39;s site on a subscription basis. The data bandwidths are kept to a minimum by transmitting information that cannot be obtained directly by the user and by updating information by classes and according to how quickly each class of data goes stale given the realities of the GPS system. Sub-decimeter-level kinematic accuracy over a given area is accomplished by establishing a mini-fiducial network.","['701/480.', '701/471.', '342/357.72', '701/470.', '342/358.', '701/478.', '342/357.27']","['G01S5/0009', 'G01S19/07', 'G01S19/32']","['G01S19/44', 'G01S5/14', 'G01S5/00', 'G01S19/32']","['US-4751512-A', 'US-4646096-A', 'US-5155490-A', 'US-5225842-A', 'US-4797677-A', 'US-5202829-A']","[0.03559907, -0.068365395, -0.03902581, -0.01690899, 0.101205, -0.035703223, 0.0016886571, -0.11387532, 0.20600502, -0.04148246, -0.16937384, 0.17651373, 0.09251015, 0.012092576, 0.09919224, 0.08908904, 0.058734514, -0.01105186, -0.22848007, 0.17599365, 0.24448569, -0.06829654, -0.09105126, 0.1408882, -0.07770554, -0.062210444, 0.06481013, 0.29469243, 0.16415453, -0.03070157, 0.04824662, -0.20727181, -0.18681684, -0.087421924, -0.09141901, 0.063144214, -0.031686924, -0.2769111, -0.09252808, 0.109517016, -0.24762987, -0.14850675, 0.048347462, 0.0045732018, 0.01687818, -0.12557925, -0.038351994, 0.112294056, -0.08991946, 0.050228998, -0.18854801, -0.04390252, -0.07457643, 0.0003925917, 0.0927809, 0.04846349, 0.17733312, 0.012961176, -0.1398866, 0.14916138, 0.044444893, 0.15834202, -0.20766538, 0.081334844]",True

A mobile GPS station within or adjacent to the region S has stored within it the coordinates (u&#39;,v&#39;,w&#39;) of the GPS-determined last location of that mobile station and the spatial coordinates (u n (k),v n (k),w n (k)) (k=1, 2 , . . . , K; K&gt;3) of K GPS reference stations within S that are closest to the last-determined location of that mobile station. The mobile station then computes the differential GPS corrections for the GPS-determined present location of that mobile station. Alternatively, the reference stations can transmit to the central station unprocessed GPS signals for determination of the pseudorange correction signals at the central station. This approach can be modified if the region R is two-dimensional, where only two coordinates u and v are needed, or if the region R is one-dimensional, where only one coordinate u is needed. Suitable algorithms for selection of the coefficients a k&#39;   are discussed.","['342/450.', '342/357.31', '701/469.', '340/988.', '701/470.']","['G01S19/41', 'G01S19/07', 'G01S19/04']","['G01S19/11', 'G01S5/14', 'G01S5/00', 'G01S19/48']","['US-4607257-A', 'US-4494211-A', 'US-4963889-A', 'US-5471217-A', 'US-4463357-A', 'US-4014166-A', 'US-4337463-A', 'US-4812991-A', 'US-5072227-A', 'US-4578678-A', 'US-5138631-A', 'US-5099245-A', 'US-4870422-A', 'US-4809005-A', 'US-4646096-A', 'US-5519620-A', 'US-5155490-A', 'US-4287597-A', 'US-4292683-A', 'US-4797677-A', 'US-5194871-A', 'US-4582434-A', 'US-3811265-A', 'US-3881310-A', 'US-3941984-A', 'US-5563917-A', 'US-4912475-A', 'US-5111209-A', 'US-5477458-A', 'US-4042923-A', 'US-5148179-A', 'US-4445118-A', 'US-4860018-A', 'US-5471218-A', 'US-3520128-A', 'US-4751512-A', 'US-4218654-A', 'US-5220333-A', 'US-3852534-A', 'US-4334314-A', 'US-4405986-A', 'US-5343209-A', 'US-4449830-A', 'US-4543657-A', 'US-4814711-A']","[0.030215522, 0.093503736, -0.08271853, -0.010999237, 0.043056395, 0.020829378, -0.0023422441, -0.056007054, 0.13520026, -0.021493685, -0.17342797, 0.15975492, 0.15470016, -0.028643593, -0.010981444, 0.014931646, 0.045652788, 0.02762227, -0.30204976, 0.077646986, 0.25107598, -0.09502004, 0.021235183, 0.22230309, -0.043242525, -0.0061361156, 0.029320346, 0.32316208, 0.16447575, -0.04412529, 0.18308125, -0.09889995, -0.123185664, -0.051374376, -0.03696562, 0.057086177, -0.05924492, -0.23667176, -0.07491806, 0.12640111, -0.31167608, -0.1410939, 0.02538221, -0.036684047, 0.07885838, -0.048864275, 0.04786356, 0.20146507, -0.007805838, 0.12976786, -0.10721955, -0.048679665, 0.030424034, 0.059896156, 0.090258494, -0.051138476, 0.028596587, 0.12140845, -0.14824782, 0.03925975, 0.07626574, 0.20464295, -0.23176989, 0.12790093]",True

Two crown wheel plates face one another and are freely rotatable, one on a driving shaft and the other on coaxial driven shaft. The shafts also rigidly mount two facing inner planetary conical pinions that are coaxial and concentric with the respective crown wheel plates. Sandwiched between the plates are two sets of satellite pinions; the first set meshing with the crown wheel plates and the second set meshing with the planetary conical pinions. Both sets of satellite pinions freely rotate on cruciform axles. The cruciform axles, in turn, rotate freely about the coaxial driving and driven shafts. The system may be adapted to provide an automatic speed change gear system or, alternatively, a friction clutch system. In the friction clutch arrangement, one of the crown plates is held immobile so rotation is transmitted to the other crown plate indirectly by the cruciform axles and satellite gears. If braking forces are applied selectively to the rotating plate, rotational movement of the driving shaft will be passed smoothly through the satellite gears to the driven shaft. In the automatic speed change gear system, one crown wheel plate and a corresponding planetary conical pinion are interconnected by a rotary conditioning system so the remaining plate and pinion can be controlled to produce varied rotational velocity of the driven shaft.","['475/347.', '475/329.', '475/307.']",['F16H3/44'],['F16H3/44'],"['US-1208644-A', 'DE-489902-C', 'US-1457945-A', 'US-3403584-A', 'US-759157-A', 'US-1416074-A', 'US-3138039-A', 'US-3511112-A', 'US-2881639-A', 'US-3119281-A', 'US-1049577-A', 'US-4055091-A', 'FR-495873-A']",",",False

Power requirements are further reduced by use of very low power high accuracy time and frequency circuits in GPS based tracking units. The microprocessor based GPS tracking system is shut down almost all the time, using extremely little electrical power, and is powered up for very short periods of time at scheduled intervals by an extremely low power clock circuit with accuracy that varies with temperature. Each time the microprocessor is powered up, system temperature is recorded in memory. At times when the microprocessor is powered up, the GPS system is accessed and the GPS standard time is read. The difference between the low power clock circuit based time and the GPS based time is correlated with the recorded temperature history. A correction table, built from this data, provides a temperature history based correction to the low power clock based circuit without reference to the GPS system, and provides a highly accurate time standard. An additional table constructed in the microprocessor temperature compensates the local frequency standard used for frequency synthesis in satellite communication channels. This table is constructed by measuring offset between the calculated and actual synthesized frequency required to lock onto the satellite transmitted reference (pilot tone), and correlating this measured offset with the system ambient temperature.","['342/357.74', '342/357.62', '331/66.']","['G01S19/34', 'G01S19/235']",['G01S1/00'],"['US-5594453-A', 'US-5654718-A']",",",True

A plurality of digital processing systems, such as a first and a second digital processing systems, are coupled to the communication network to receive the satellite ephemeris data which is transmitted through the communication network. The first digital processing system receives a first pseudorange data from a first SPS mobile receiver and calculates a first position information of the first SPS mobile receiver from a representation of the first pseudorange data and from satellite ephemeris data received from the communication network. The first digital processing system may also receive pseudorange corrections from the communication network and use these corrections to correct the first pseudorange data to provide the representation of the first pseudorange data. The second digital processing system receives a second pseudorange data from a second SPS mobile receiver and calculates a second position of the second SPS mobile receiver using the second pseudorange data (which may be corrected using pseudorange corrections from the communication network) and using satellite ephemeris data received from the communication network. In one embodiment of this example of the invention, the mobile SPS receivers are communicatively coupled with the digital processing systems in part through a wireless cell based communication system.
